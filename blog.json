      "content": "Dinner time! Today I made vegan Tom Yum soup with Tofu, served with rice and green tea :)\n\nHere's the recipe:\n\n-   1 tbsp olive oil\n-   1 onion, chopped\n-   3 cloves garlic, minced\n-   2 tbsp vegan Tom Yum paste\n    -   If you don't have any, check <:#Tom Yum paste>\n-   2 cups of cabbage, chopped\n-   1 carrot, grated\n-   1 head of broccoli, chopped\n-   250 g medium-firm tofu, cubed\n-   2 cups of crushed tomatoes\n-   2 tbsp dark soy sauce\n-   1/2 tsp dried basil\n-   1/2 tsp red dried paprika powder\n-   Salt and pepper to taste\n-   4 cups water\n-   1 cup rice (optional)\n\n## Cooking time\n\n-   Total time: 45-65 minutes\n    -   Preparation time: 15-25 minutes\n    -   Cooking time: 30-40 minutes\n\n## Tom Yum paste\n\nIf you don't have Tom Yum paste, you can easily make it by mixing:\n\n-   8 g granulated white sugar\n-   6 g salt\n-   5 g vegetable oil\n-   10 g lemon zest\n-   4 g chilli powder\n-   2 g citric acid\n-   1.5 g ginger root\n\nOf course you may get a different result depending on your ingredients, but this is not a bad alternative if you don't have Tom Yum paste.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium to medium high heat.\n2. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cook until they are soft and fragrant.\n3. Stir in the vegan Tom Yum paste and continue to cook for about a minute.\n4. Add the chopped cabbage, carrot, and broccoli to the pot. Combine them by stirring.\n5. Add the tofu cubes to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the tofu is heated through.\n6. Pour in the crushed canned tomatoes, the soy sauce, and water.\n7. Add in the died basil and paprika.\n8. Season with salt and pepper.\n9. Bring the soup to simmer.\n10. Cover the pot and let simmer for about 20-30 minutes, until the veggies are soft.\n11. While the soup is simmering, cook your rice according to package directions.\n12. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n13. Serve your soup hot with a side of rice and (optionally) green tea.\n\nEnjoy! This makes 4-5 servings easily.\n\nPicture (fediverse conversation): <https://ak.ari.lt/notice/Ah5UMaRDmaUYIJ3fSy>\n\n## Nutrition\n\nThis is just an estimate, do not take it as final and fact - yours may (and most likely will) vary depending on the ingredients used,\nand I am not a dietician.

      "content": "I was given a task to interpret how a modern hell would be, I did it. I wrote the English version in full and then needed to translate it to Lithuanian as the task was to originally write it in Lithuanian, the problem is that I suck at Lithuanian, which is where my friend (who chose to stay anonymous) comes in. They helped me to fix my grammatical mistakes.\n\nKeep in mind that the Lithuanian and English versions may differ, both went through two different review processes.\nAnd, of course, there can be errors.

Hopelessly unquenchable social validation thirst\n2. Never-ending stream of information\n3. Hopeless hard work\n4. Forever running away from reality\n5. Emotional crisis\n6. Outside world crisis\n\nThese layers each get progressively worse and come with harder and more torturous punishments. This is not traditional hell. This is a mind hell.\n\nDifferent circles of hell are associated with different 'modern sins':\n\n1. Hopelessly unquenchable social validation thirst: Narcissism, being a self-centred person without a care for others, disregarding others and what they say.\n2. Never-ending stream of information: Disinformation, forceful delusion, conspiracies, etc. - purposefully misleading others.\n3. Hopeless hard work: Exploitation and/or abuse of people, for example being unfair or dishonest about what they deserve at their expense.\n4. Forever running away from reality: Escapism rather than confrontation in life, a way of living to not experience or learn any of the unpleasant parts of life, leaving life without having learned anything.\n5. Emotional crisis: Abusing people, hurting them, manipulation, etc - making a person feel horrible about themselves when they did not deserve it or ask for it, such as racism.\n6. Outside world crisis: Hurting the environment (not nature in particular, but also people and everything around you), trashing it, not preserving what's left, pollution, non-ethical/non-moral acts to the things around you.\n\nThe sins are not one-time offense, you will only go to hell if it's constant, it is a forgiven offense to commit to one of those sins and later grow from it. Best way to learn is to make mistakes.\n\n#### What is hell\n\nHell is a place like the current world you're currently living in, however it is build to go against you. You don't know that. You don't even know you're in hell, actually. But the world you're put to will be set against you, in one way or another, and you'll be forced into torture, and death, which you will so crave, won't be an option. You're stuck there for eternity.\n\nIn hell, you'll still feel normal senses such as cold, hunger, thirst, emotions, smell, taste, etc. Though, that doesn't mean you'll be quench it.\n\n#### Descriptions of circles of hell\n\nThis section describes what each circle of the modern hell is.\n\nCircles are worlds which you can only go down in, there's no going up. You can either stay where you are, or you can commit a sin to go down a layer.\n\nThe circle you get in depends on your committed sins. You can also commit those same sins in hell. If you commit a sin in hell, you go down a layer, if not multiple, and then there's no way to go up.\n\nAt the very bottom there's a reserved space called \"The Void\", in which people who have made significant progress and learned a lot from their suffering in hell over many years can go as an escape. In The Void there's absolutely nothing, you're left there floating around in the dark, with nothingness surrounding you. This is the closest thing to an escape you'll ever experience here.\n\n##### Circle 1: Hopelessly unquenchable social validation thirst\n\nThis lighter version of modern torment, which is as though you're trapped in a realm where the need for continual social approval becomes insatiable.\n\nAt first, you bask in the glow of validation, as if you're atop the world. But, similarly to a shooting star, it fades away. Quick. It's as if your significance withers away in a jiffy, leaving nothing but void behind. The world around you seems to have forgotten your existence, as if you've become invisible entirely, and every effort you put into breaking out of this jail will be futile. The longing for being on top of the world is still there, unfulfilled - this inflicts a deeper wound far deeper than making you feel invisible or unheard. This realization of your poisoned mind drives the light away from your eyes, plunging you into straight, vile, deep, and dark depression. The sad realization that you're no longer appreciated, or seen as important, being unheard and feeling invisible hits fast, but now there's no way you're going back to the top.\n\nThis is all a game to play with your psyche. Maybe now you'll learn. Enjoy your stay just as if everyone is enjoying their life outside, except you, of course, which worsens your pain.\n\nWith time, you lose grip of sanity, it goes out of your reach. You resort to doing extreme and shocking things to get noticed, but nobody answers to your pleas for attention. Things get worse until you're completely alone, unable to meet even your basic needs, which, consequently, pushes you further into total insanity.\n\nYou might start of thinking of death as your sole escape, but you can't even manage that. This is a form of suffering after all, there's no break or escape from it. Even though you can't harm yourself, you'll still feel physical pain. Your dive into madness continues, and the thoughts you wish you could silence just make everything worse. If only you could stop thinking, but you can't. You're unsatisfied. You're left in bare plains with zero escape. This discomfort sticks with you, and is at the core of this painful experience.\n\nThis is justice for all you've done in your previous life, and this is only the beginning. Watch your step, or you may fall into a lower circle of hell.\n\n##### Circle 2: Never-ending stream of information\n\nWelcome to the circle of never-ending stream of information. You're here for to suffer for all the fear, confusion, and doubt you've caused in the past.\n\nThis world is as if the internet came alive, you being bombarded with a constant stream of information, which may or may not be true, it always contradicts itself, making you paranoid about the reality of things, questioning everything, pushing you into intense paranoia. As you're trying to figure out what's real and what's not, you realize that your grip on reality is getting looser and everything is becoming blurry and shapeless, resulting in frustration, which makes you fall into a fit of rage and a pit of darkness and confusion.\n\nSlowly, the whole world falls into paranoia, not yet chaos, but close. Every process becomes a long and complicated mess, because of the false information spreading in masses. This is a punishment for the false statements you've promoted in the past, for justice to all the confusion, fear, and uncertainty you've caused, not specifically on such a mass scale, but you've sinned, the mess and chaos you've created of the world or people's mind. You may or may not realize that all this is your fault, which may cause you feel deep regret and sorrow.\n\nAll of this mess inside of you and the world around you causes you go into self isolation, same as everyone. You're stuck with fake news sources, unable to turn them off, addicted to the high of validation and pulled in by the rage of news which don't align with your perception of reality or the same news making question your own ideas, making you anxious about your extremist views. You fall victim to even more intense paranoia with time, not knowing how to interpret anything in life anymore, you bang your head against the wall hoping to get an answer - you begin doing anything in your power to uncover the truth, but more fake news fill your mind.\n\nYou cannot stop thinking. You keep finding new links between two completely unrelated things, making a network of nonsensical paranoid thoughts in your head. This causes you immense overwhelmingness, and you continue to lose control over your thoughts and physical body. Your constant heightened state of mind tires you and causes you discomfort, but you cannot do anything besides stay where you are, or fall deeper into the confusion, which happens regardless if you want it or not.\n\nThe closest thing to an escape there is now is your own mind, a loud and uncomfortable mess, full of thoughts and constantly rushing with contradictions. You fall into it as if there's no other needs left to satisfy: No sleep, no eating, no drinking, none of the basic needs met. Just you, stuck hearing fake news, and your sorrow, paranoia, and anxiety. Like they say - karma is a bitch, your past came back to haunt you ten times worse.\n\nYour only goal now is not lose grip on reality fully that you forget that it only get worse from now on.\n\n##### Circle 3: Hopeless hard work\n\nJust like in the Greek myth about Sisyphus, you will work hopeless, long, and hard work in this world, forever. With no escape.\n\nMost of this world is filled with so-called \"successful\" people, such as Jeff Bezos, who always mistreated their workers and lied about what the workers really deserve, lying to them. Same as the individual abusers and manipulators, who lie and make a person fall into submission by putting them down, invalidating every single thing they do, manipulating everything in their life to make it seem that it's against them. Now, the world is against the abuser, you.\n\nIn the Greek myth about Sisyphus, Sisyphus was a king who was punished for deceitfulness by being forced to roll a huge boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again every time it neared the top. Similarly, in this world you will feel like everything is an extremely hard task which will take you hours to even near completion, just for it to fail, and you having to re-do it all over again.\n\nWork will go badly, hobbies will go badly, satisfying your needs will go badly, life in general will become an insufferable agony. Everything will feel like it's in slow-motion. You will have no other options besides suffering or suffering, except if you don't do any work there's only one - down.\n\nEvery day in this world will be extremely hard, and it'll only get harder to do anything, you will be extremely exhausted and hopeless daily, just like the people you put through the same torture, at their expense. Just now, what was half their life, is now your everyday.\n\nThere's no escape from this, it'll push you into an extremely deep depression and an aching state of exhaustion.\n\nIf you choose to not do anything about it, laying around is going to push you into insanity, from the sore and constant pressure you feel to do something from the voices in your head. They keep bothering you, and you have no breathing room.\n\nThis is for all the abuse and exploitation you did in your past. This was their reality, and now it's your everyday :)\n\n##### Circle 4: Forever running away from reality\n\nIn this circle, you're sentenced to an eternity of nightmare-inducing consequences. It's crafted to grant your every wish, however every wish comes with a devastating consequence. You wanted to escape the reality, didn't you? Welcome to a reality that's far from anything you've ever known, to a reality where you cannot distinguish illusion from truth.\n\nIn this reality you'll be forced to face your biggest fears - challenges you so wanted to escape and live an easy life.\n\nThink of your deepest desires, the ones you wishes for without considering any of the challenges that come with it. Here, in this universe, they will all come true, but then the devastating challenges of the unforeseen reality will come to bite you.\n\nEver thought about drowning in power and wealth? Have them, but with them, comes the crushing loneliness, and paranoia of losing it all. Or, how about beauty and the attention it harbours? Well, you're now the most attractive person in the world. You became a target of immense jealousy leading to plots against you, sabotage, even torturing. But, of course, you cannot die, this is an eternal suffering. Every wish you hope for, anything, will come with devastating lessons about life, which you could've easily learned in life, but you chose to take the easy path and live in delusion.\n\nThe funny irony of all of this is that life was always tough, the only difference was the evasion. But now, the dreams that you clung to so relentlessly your whole life pull you deep into monstrous nightmares.\n\nYou've trapped yourself in an echo chamber of dreams in your past, constantly trying to avoid the outcomes of your goals. You become lost within yourself, longing for the mundane reality you once had, but will never return back to the original state. Because, now - you're here. Life, as you once knew it, is now an unattainable mirage, it's deformed by your own creations. The only escape is now a journey deeper into hell.\n\nYour eternity will be a constant chase of escape from the nightmares you've created. You'll be wishing for the end of it all, but it'll only push you further down into depression and guilt, knowing that there's only no escape from it and that you're at fault of all of this. The paranoia of knowing that every thought of yours will come to life also haunts you while your brain works in overdrive. Only if you've learned in your previous life to confront your fears rather than deceiving yourself that they doesn't exist.\n\nThis is the world of eternal suffering, a world where every dream just creates more vivid nightmares. Welcome to misery.\n\n##### Circle 5: Emotional crisis\n\nHere, you'll embrace a world of complete emotional crisis. You've caused a lot of hardship in the past, now it is time for your own woe.\n\nHere, you'll be living in the perfect world, where everyone is happy with themselves and their life. Where the birds are singing, nature's thriving, and weather's sunny. But there will only be one outlier - you.\n\nYou will suffer a lot. You will be the most miserable person there, nobody will talk to you, nobody will like you, everyone will constantly put you down for being such a buzzkill, being a complete narc. You will hate yourself and everything around you, and everyone being so happy with everything will only make it worse.\n\nSee, how it was living next to an abuser like you?\n\nYou will not only become your own abuser, you will live around people that despise you. This will force you into a painfully deep anguish. This vile feeling will only get worse, it'll push you further and further into an emotional crisis. You'll breakdown daily, if not hourly. It'll coerce you into self destruction while everyone is laughing at everything you do. You'll be like a cute little lab experiment to everyone, everyone will feed off your sorrow and affliction.\n\nDaily will be nothing but malaise, and the world won't let you forget that, you will be alienated, manipulated, silenced, and laughed at. You can express your emotions all you want, but nobody will care. It'll just make it worse. Sometimes people will actually listen to you, pretending as if they care, somehow every time manipulating you into giving them an answer, just to use all of that information against you.\n\nYou're funny. You were the same people laughing at you in your past. You caused a lot of affliction, yet you still pretend to be a victim.\n\nThere's only barren chaos below here. You think it can't get any worse?\n\n##### Circle 6: Outside world crisis\n\nThis is the worst layer of hell, below here there is nothing. You've been dragged through all the chaos of the previous circles, and now you're here. Welcome, scum.\n\nHere, the whole world is in total chaos and panic, including yourself. Paranoia, depression, angst, hardship, suffering, nature dying, withering of life, thought process, corruption, etc. - everything, and I mean everything, is an extreme mess. There's nothing left in order, everything feels like a burning wound in your life.\n\nThe world will be endless, every corner filled with as much discomfort as possible, no escape or peace as usual, constant anguish. Dead bodies everywhere, emotional crises, a world which is falling apart, no relations at all, let alone peaceful ones. Economy is horrible, mental health is at all time low, political parties creating horrible groups of oppressors, centralized power regimes, everyone and everything controlled by couple if not a single entity, everyone's being watched. Every second of life feels like an extreme horror film in which you confront every single one of your fears.\n\nNot stopping there. Poverty, homelessness, starvation. Everyone is extremely individualistic and there's no culture and working as a group. Everyone is self-obsessed and centred on singular things. Health is horrible, addiction is all over, immoral and unethical acts everywhere: bestiality, paedophilia, discrimination, homicide, torturing - all displayed in public, causing you trauma. Everything is extremely graphic and intense.\n\nThis never ending chaos stings. Even if you don't feel any empathy towards others or yourself, which is highly unlikely in such environment filled with total emotion - it'll be extremely hard to live. There's nothing but painful fire.\n\nThere's nothing worse than this abyss. What's left below is Void. But that would be an escape. There's no way you're ever visiting that place in this state, only people who have made significant progress and learned a lot can have the sweet escape of Void - a place where you get to exist with no torture or chaos, forever floating around in nothingness, which is the best you're ever going to get here.\n\nThis is for hurting the environment around you. Enjoy your stay, or learn - as there's nothing else you can do here now. Good luck learning from your mistakes in such an environment though.\n\n#### Modern Sinners\n\nHere, we will be exposing some modern-day sinners, and will be placing some figures who have caused a lot of soreness in the world.\n\n##### Circle 1: Hopelessly unquenchable social validation thirst\n\nKanye West is a perfect candidate for this circle. Kanye (also known as just Ye) is a famour rapper and fashion designer known for his public outbursts and a constant need validation and conversations and controversies to revolve around him. His numerous horrible self-centred acts and other narcissistic behaviour proved him time and time again to be harmful and a bad influence on his fans.\n\n##### Circle 2: Never-ending stream of information\n\nAlex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and owner of the InfoWars website, is infamous for promoting false information and conspiracy theories. Alex's disinformation campaigns have caused mass confusion and harm in the past, and continues to harbour a bad community who constantly inflicts harm on others.\n\n##### Circle 3: Hopeless hard work\n\nA notable figure in this circle could be Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who is notorious for exploiting his employees with low pay, inhumane working conditions, and extremely long working hours. Bazos' company has been the star of numerous human and labour rights controversies, and Amazon's values only continue to cause further harm and cause more controversies with time.\n\n##### Circle 4: Forever running away from reality\n\nFacebook, a platform constantly filled with scandals, deceptive practices, and privacy issues, is known to present itself in a squeaky clean mirage, when it is anything but that. The lies of it being perfectly normal and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, constantly deflecting and avoiding any criticism presented towards Facebook, makes Mark the perfect candidate for this circle.\n\n##### Circle 5: Emotional crisis\n\nHave you ever heard of the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse? Well, Harvey Weinstein is an infamous figure which started it all. He is a famous film producer who has been accused by many women of emotional, sexual and physical abuse. He has always been a controversial figure in the world, and has caused a lot of scandal in the past. This harm he has caused makes him the first person who comes to mind when you think of this circle.\n\n##### Circle 6: Outside world crisis\n\nUnsurprisingly, the covering power of many places are self-absorbed and have no care for anything around them. Taking the sin of this circle literally, we could Jair Bolsonaro in this circle. Jair was the president of Brazil who is known for his harm for the environment. Particularly, the Amazon rainforest, causing mass deforestation due to his catastrophic policies.\n\n## Lithuanian version\n\n### Modernusis pragaras\n\nMano \u0161iuolaikinio pragaro interpretacija. 2024/03/14 (su pi diena!)\n\nLicencija: GPLv3+ (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)\n\n#### Pragaro ratai\n\n1.

      "content": "This is my second speech for school, high-school level (10th grade). This is the speech that will be used in my upcoming oral exam in Lithuanian. Enjoy, once again open sourcing this as I open source pretty much everything :)\n\nFirst speech: <https://blog.ari.lt/b/10-th-grader-speech-george-orwell-animal-farm/>\n\n### Licensing\n\nFor **educational purposes only** you are free to use this speech (if you ever do) under CC0 - no rights reserved:\n\n> Speech about George Orwell's books \"1984\" \"Animal Farm\" by Ari Archer is marked with CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n\\- <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0?ref=ari.lt>\n\nFor any other purposes than educational, you shall follow the licensing provided on this page's footer and metadata.\n\n### Speech\n\nDear fellow students and respected teachers,\n\nToday I stand before you to share my thoughts on two George Orwell's, an influential English writer, most brilliant books, \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\". These insightful masterpieces mirror Orwell's grim prophesy of totalitarian regimes, manipulation, and misuse of propaganda, which can continue to resonate today. Both of these creative works portray the snowballing of governing systems into a rough dystopian reality in different ways.\n\nTo begin, let's settle into the dystopian reality of \"1984\". It represents a chilling depiction of totalitarianism, a system of governance where the citizens are under total control of a singular political authority - centralized absolute political power. This is clearly represented by the main governance power in the book - Big Brother, who is the leader of everything, he watches everyone and everything, even your thoughts. Despite of never truly confirming the existence of Big Brother, Orwell utilizes this figure to model absolute authority and personality that usually accompany such power systems.\n\nThe role of propaganda in this totalitarian regime is also very notable. \"The Party\", who rules the nation, manipulates reality through manipulating historical records, as said in the book - \"one who controls the past, controls the present and the future\". This manipulation of truth and distortion of reality gives rise of the concept of \"doublethink\". It is a form of overwhelmed critical thinking which coerces citizens into passively accepting two contradictory beliefs at the same time - a clever mind-control technique used by the Party. The Party implements many mind control tricks to force people into submission to the government.\n\nConversely, Orwell's symbolic story \"Animal Farm\" paints a grim picture of dictatorship. The farm animals, who represent societal groups, rebel against their tyrant farmer (an allegory for the rebellion against Czar), but their democratic society eventually turns into an oppressive regime. The name of the book (\"Animal Farm\") comes from when the animals rebelled against the farmer and renamed \"Manor Farm\" to \"Animal Farm\" to symbolize that they've claimed it.\n\nOrwell uses the pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, who gradually gain power, to highlight the danger of centralized power in hands of a singular entity. Napoleon's relentless pursuit of power resonates with every dictator in world history. His leadership morphs into a totalitarian regime, and the once cherished principles of Animalism are manipulated to suit the pigs' needs. Contrarily, Snowball represents a good power which was an Animalism activist, who was overthrown by Napoleon's propaganda and relentless craving for power. It is believed that Napoleon is a representation of the Soviet dictator of 1920s - Joseph Stalin, and Snowball is believed to be representing Leon Trotsky, a revolutionary Marxist and political theorist who played a key role in the Russian revolution of 1917.\n\nPropaganda in \"Animal Farm\" is personified by Squealer, Napoleon's right-hand pig. Squealer's speech and persuasion manipulate the other farm animals into believing that the pigs' ruthless orders are for everyone's benefit. His twisted use of wording, statistics, and logical fallacies such as Appeal to Fear masks the reality of their oppressive government and living conditions. This character underscores Orwell's critique of the misuse of propaganda by totalitarian governments to control and change public opinion. This is a very common real-world propaganda tactic.\n\nIn both \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\", Orwell warns us about the dangers of propaganda in totalitarian regimes. Through the use of mind control, the rewriting of history, information suppression, fear tactics, and centralization of power. These works show how totalitarian regimes can dictate what is \"truth\" and \"reality\" - in other words, dictatorship.\n\nOrwell's works may seem grim and pessimistic, however they are discrete warnings resonating with the course of human history. Their universal relevance speaks to the resilience of free thinking and the fearless refusal to submit to authority. These works will most likely almost always stay relevant as history repeats itself, and we must take these warnings and stay aware of unchallenged authority or else we may fall victim to oppressive regimes once again.\n\nIn conclusion, Orwell\u2019s \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\" go beyond mere storytelling, they integrate thought-provoking political commentary with critical insight of totalitarianism and the role of propaganda in totalitarian governance systems. Looking at both novels, Orwell's primary message remains clear: In a world where truth becomes a joke of those in power, it is our responsibility as individuals to question and analyze their wrongs, and stay ware of oppressive governments.\n\nRemember, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\". So let\u2019s be the animals that stand for equality, truth and freedom. Thank you.\n\n### Plan\n\n-   Greeting\n-   Intro\n    -   George Orwell - influential English writer\n    -   Brilliant books (\"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\")\n    -   Insightful masterpieces\n    -   Orwell's grim prophesy of totalitarian regimes, manipulation, and misuse of propaganda\n    -   Resonance in today's world\n    -   Political systems snowballing into rough dystopian realities\n-   George Orwell - 1984: A dystopian reality\n    -   Chilling depiction of totalitarianism\n        -   Singular political authority\n        -   Centralized absolute power\n    -   Big Brother - representation of a centralized totalitarian authority\n        -   Watches everyone and everything (even your thoughts)\n        -   Existence never truly confirmed\n        -   Used to model authority and personality of totalitarian systems\n    -   Notable role propaganda\n        -   The Party - the singular entity who rules the nation\n        -   The Party manipulates history\n            -   \"One who controls the past, controls the present and the future\"\n        -   Concept: Doublethink\n            -   Form of overwhelmed critical thinking which coerces citizens into passively accepting two contradictory beliefs at the same time\n            -   Mind-control technique used by the Party\n                -   Not the only mind-control trick used by the Party to force people into submission for authority\n-   George Orwell - Animal Farm: A utopian society with a government which snowballs into a dystopian reality\n    -   Animals represent societal groups who rebel against their tyrant farmer (oppressive governments)\n        -   Allegory for rebellion against Czar\n    -   The society's government slowly snowballs into a totalitarian regime\n    -   The name: Foreshadowing into the storyline\n        -   Animals reclaimed the \"Manor Farm\" and renamed it to \"Animal Farm\"\n    -   Pigs and government\n        -   Main pigs: Napoleon and Snowball\n        -   Highlights the dangers of a centralized authority\n        -   Napoleon's relentless pursuit of power resonates with world history dictators\n            -   His leadership turns into a totalitarian regime\n                -   Destruction of core values: Animalism\n                -   Manipulated to fit pigs' needs\n        -   Snowball - opposition to Napoleon\n            -   Animalism activist\n            -   Overthrown by Napoleon's propaganda and craving for power\n        -   Allegorical representation: Napoleon and Snowball\n            -   Napoleon - Joseph Stalin - 1920s Soviet Dictator\n            -   Snowball - Leon Trotsky - revolutionary Marxist and political theorist, played a key role in the Russian revolution of 1917\n    -   Propaganda in \"Animal Farm\": Squealer the pig\n        -   Napoleon's right-hand pig\n        -   Squealer's speech and persuasion manipulate people\n            -   Wording\n            -   Statistics\n            -   Logical fallacies (Appeal to Fear)\n            -   Masking of oppressive reality and their living conditions\n            -   Allegory: Misuse of propaganda\n                -   Control and change of public opinion\n                -   Common real-world propaganda tactic\n-   Messaging in both books\n    -   Dangers of propaganda in totalitarian regimes\n    -   Manipulation\n        -   Mind control\n        -   Rewriting of history\n        -   Information suppression\n        -   Fear tactics (Appeal to Fear)\n        -   Centralization of power\n    -   Dictatorship: Dictating what's \"truth\" and \"reality\"\n-   Orwell's works\n    -   Grim and pessimistic\n    -   Discrete warnings resonating with human history\n    -   Universal relevance\n        -   Free thinking\n        -   Fearless refusal and questioning of authority\n    -   Forever relevance of the works\n        -   Human history repeats\n        -   We must question and stay ware of unchallenged authority\n            -   May fall victim to oppressive regimes once again\n-   Conclusion: Beyond mere storytelling\n    -   Integration of thought-provoking political commentary\n    -   Critical insight of totalitarianism and the role of propaganda\n    -   Both novels' messages: In a world where truth becomes a joke of those in power, it is our responsibility as individuals to question and analyze their wrongs, and stay ware of oppressive governments\n-   Goodbye\n    -   \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\" - let\u2019s be the animals that stand for equality, truth and freedom",

I don't want to include it as I don't want this post to be huge with repetitive information.\n\n### Licensing\n\nFor **educational purposes only** you are free to use this speech (if you ever do) under CC0 - no rights reserved:\n\n> Speech about George Orwell's book \"Animal Farm\" by Ari Archer is marked with CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n\\- <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0?ref=ari.lt>\n\nFor any other purposes than educational, you shall follow the licensing provided on this page's footer and metadata.\n\n### Speech\n\nDear people,\n\nToday, I stand here to not just to talk about a book - rather to explore philosophy, symbolism, and societal commentary scattered around its pages. The book in focus is the infamous \"Animal Farm\" by the influential English writer - George Orwell.\n\nBefore we deep dive into the book I'd like to take a moment to present the author of this book. George Orwell, born on June 25th of 1903, as Eric Arthur Blair, he later adopted his writer name as we know it today - George Orwell. Orwell was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His works are characterized by clarity, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, he's an outspoken port of democratic socialism. His masterpieces portray power as a keen eye for effects of poverty, a theme which echos throughout his books from his first book called \"Down and Out in Paris and London\", published in 1933.\n\n\"Animal Farm\" is among the most celebrated of Orwell's creations, \"Animal Farm\" is a unique blend of political satire, dystopian fiction, and allegorical storytelling. It was published on August 17th of 1945, at a time where the world was still devastated by effects of World War II. Throughout the book, he managed to expose and criticize the corruption and brutal totalitarianism that come with absolute political power.\n\n\"Animal Farm\" is a clever novel which uses animals to allegorically express the storyline to create a unique utopian society which slowly becomes a dystopian reality. It begins good, but then slowly deteriorates into a harsh, corrupt, and bitter state of governance, depicting a bitter reality of many political systems. The animals in the book do not merely represent themselves, but rather each has its real-world political history, this becomes clearer and clearer as you read into the very clear allegory that Orwell created in the storyline.\n\nThe pigs, who present the leaders of the rebellion, represent those who are in charge - the politicians. It's very clever, in my opinion, how the pigs are presented as the government, as pigs are known as this dirty and gross animal in many cultures. I feel like this not only represents the governing power in the book well, but also real-world governments and their actions. Many sources claim that The character of Napoleon, a large boar, can be seen as a representation of Joseph Stalin, a Soviet leader from the mid-1920s to his demise in 1953, a ruthless figure who forced policies such as collectivization and purges, consolidating power and transforming the Soviet Union into an industrialized but authoritarian state. The same sources also claim that Snowball, another pig, represents the political theorist Leon Trotsky, a prominent Marxist revolutionary who played a key role in the Russian Revolution, advocating for international socialism, and later becoming a vocal critic of Joseph Stalin's authoritarian control in 1920s to early 1930s.\n\nOrwell's writing style applications and a stage of reality portrayed in the book, makes the readers think and relate to the real world around them. The book provides a critical examination of complexities and issues of any political system, which, even though formed with high ideals (how most political systems start), can quickly snowball into an authoritarian mess, poverty, centralized power, and manipulation (political propaganda?). Any political system can fall victim to corruption, inequality, and exploitation.\n\nDuring the development of the storyline in the book, there were many portrayed inequalities (or as the pigs would call it \"Some animals are more equal than others\"), change of the 7 laws they made to create a society where the animals could live peacefully and happily to match the authoritarian leader's wants and privileges. I found one part funny in particular where the pigs changed the basic right of \"All animals are equal\" to \"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others\" - this part stuck with me as a funny moment, showing how badly degraded and corrupt the political system there was.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Animal Farm\" By George Orwell is not just a book, it is a mirror reflecting our society's often masked artifacts. On its surface it may appear as a simple tale of farm animals, but beneath the surface it's a political satire representing a pungent society and leaders, commenting with that with on-point political critique.\n\nThank you for lending me your time and giving me the opportunity to share this amazing work by George Orwell with you today. Have a good rest of your day.\n\n### Plan\n\n-   Greeting\n-   Not just a book (intro)\n    -   Philosophy\n    -   Symbolism\n    -   Societal commentary\n-   Author\n    -   Influential English writer\n    -   Born on June 25th of 1903\n    -   Real name - Eric Arthur Blair\n        -   Later adopted his writer name - George Orwell\n    -   English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic\n    -   Works characterized by clarity, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, pro-democratic socialism\n    -   Power to poverty, common theme\n        -   Even from his first book - \"Down and Out in Paris and London\", published in 1933\n-   \"Animal Farm\" is one of the most celebrated works by him\n    -   Unique blend of political satire, dystopian fiction, and allegorical storytelling\n    -   published on August 17th of 1945\n        -   People were still devastated by effects of World War II\n        -   The storyline exposes and criticizes corruption and brutal totalitarianism\n            -   Absolute political power\n-   \"Animal Farm\" is a clever allegorical novel with a unique storyline\n    -   Unique utopian society which degrades into a dystopian reality\n        -   Toxic state of governance\n            -   Harsh\n            -   Corrupt\n            -   Bitter\n        -   Reality of many political systems\n    -   The animals don't represent merely themselves\n        -   Actual real-world political history\n-   Allegory: animals are not merely animals\n    -   Pigs - politicians\n        -   Pigs are viewed as dirty and gross in many cultures\n            -   Clever\n        -   Accurate representation of real-world governments and\n        -   Main pigs: Snowball and Napoleon\n            -   Napoleon is believed to represent Joseph Stalin\n                -   Soviet leader from the mid-1920s to his demise in 1953\n                -   Ruthless figure who forced policies\n                    -   Collectivization and purges\n                    -   Consolidating power\n                    -   Transforming the Soviet Union into an industrialized but authoritarian state\n            -   Snowball is believed to represent the political theorist Leon Trotsky\n                -   Prominent Marxist revolutionary who played a key role in the Russian Revolution\n                -   Advocating for international socialism\n                -   Later becoming a vocal critic of Joseph Stalin's authoritarian control in 1920s to early 1930s\n-   Orwell's writing style and portrayed reality\n    -   Makes the readers think of the real world around them\n    -   Provides critical examination and complexities of any political system\n    -   Political system formation\n        -   Starts with high ideals\n        -   Can quickly snowball into an authoritarian mess, poverty, centralized power, and manipulation (political propaganda?)\n        -   Any political system can fall victim to corruption, inequality, and exploitation.\n-   Storyline: inequality (or as pigs would say - \"others are more equal than others\")\n    -   They made 7 basic laws\n        -   Who walks on two legs is an enemy\n        -   Who walks on four legs or has wings is a friend\n        -   No animal should wear clothes\n        -   No animal shall lie in bed\n        -   No animal shall drink alcohol\n        -   No animal shall kill any other animal\n        -   All animals are equal\n    -   The pigs kept changing them to meet their privileges and wants\n        -   Four legs is good, two is even better\n        -   Who walks on four legs or has wings is a friend (not changed)\n        -   Animals can wear clothes\n        -   Pigs require a place to rest\n        -   No animal shall drink alcohol without moderation\n        -   No animal shall kill any other animal without a reason\n        -   All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others\n            -   This stuck with me, funny - \"more equal\"\n                -   Degradation\n                -   Corruptness\n                -   Authoritarianism\n    -   Poverty\n-   Conclusion (outro)\n    -   \"Animal farm\" is not just a book\n        -   Mirror reflecting our society's often masked artifacts\n    -   On the surface seems like a tale about\n    -   Digging deeper into the creative work\n        -   Political satire\n        -   pungent society and leaders\n        -   On-point political critique\n-   Goodbye\n    -   Opportunity to share\n    -   Have a good day",

      "content": "this doml will mainly be like 'school sucks lol' but it's sorta the\nmain thing bothering me atm, anyway, with this prefixed, let's jump into\nmy angsty teenage thoughts \ud83d\udc4d\n\ni'm so stressed, daily feels like unbearable torture, i feel\nlike i'm in some sadist's bdsm dream where i'm supposed to like\nthe total torture of the system\n\nthe system literally feels like a box of zero creativity and\nfreedom, it's literally all memorization and repeating of what someone\nsomeday said, no actual learning, just tagging along w everyone else\nlol, then there's so much material and shit to learn, and then there's\ndaily tests and shit, that's extremely stressful, oh also, exams\nare near\n\ni passed my english oral exam with 17/20 points ( 85% ) not too long ago\nand i feel like i could've done better, but i was shaking in\nplace and it was so shit, it was total garbage, i hated it,\nand there's at least 1 more oral exam and 1 oral test waiting for\nme - both from lithuanian, a subject i suck big big ass in,\ni'll probably fail that, especially because i have to base it off\nlithuanian literature\n\nmy theme for the oral exam speech ( translated ) is\n\n> Totalitarianism and propaganda portrayal in\n> George Orwell's \"1984\" and \"Animal farm\".\n\nand for the test speech it's just 'Animal farm' - basically\nmy goal is to talk about animal farm by geogre orwell, that's what\ni'm supposed to do, well, at least we got to pick the books lol,\nand the themes for the exam speech\n\nwell, anyway, last year i read 1984 and i really\nenjoyed the book, though i did lose the diary thing, but my teacher\nprobably has the physical copy somewhere, yet i'll still try to write\nit out of memory lol, the blog post about 1984 can be found here : <https://blog.ari.lt/b/george-orwell-1984/>\n\nand now, i guess i kinda wanna give my opinion on animal farm, kinda side\ntracking from the main subject of this post, but still\n\n## animal farm\n\n( spoilers lol, skip to <#:messaging of animal farm> if you wanna skip the spoilers )\n\nanimal farm was cool, i preferred 1984 ngl, but animal farm was super quick\nto read ( i did it in 1 day, couple of hours ) and it wasn't too confusing or\ncomplex, i expected it to be much harder to interpret as allegories like this\ntend to be super confusing and easy to get lost in, especially when it's in\nlithuanian ( i read animal farm in lithuanian ) and it was, surprisingly smooth\n\nfirstly i thought the title was like this because people and politicians are\nportrayed as animals, but now i think it's in reference to when animals reclaimed\nthe \"manor farm\" ( ? idk i translated it lol ) and renamed it into \"animal farm\"\nand that was a moment, it was kinda damn imagining the living situation of the\nanimals literally, and situation in the current world, allegorically\n\nthen the animals sorta made like 7 commandments that sounded something like :\n\n1. Whoever walks on two legs is an enemy.\n2. He who walks on all fours or has wings is a friend.\n3. No animal shall wear clothes.\n4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.\n5. No animal is allowed to drink alcohol.\n6. No animal shall kill any other animal.\n7. All animals are equal.\n\nwhich was cool i guess, but over time pigs became the government and the superior\nanimal and stuff, and i found that funny how politicians were portrayed as\npigs, but honestly - deserved lol, but anyway\n\npigs gave themselves more privileges and stuff, saying 'managing the farm is a super\nhard job' - for example when pigs made it so they are the only ones who could drink\nmilk and eat apples ( or smt i don't really recall that too clearly right now ),\nand over time there were political fights, etc, and one thing stood out to me -\nhow the pigs ( politicians ) changed the law to fit their interests and privileges\nand whatnot, it was slowly changed to something like :\n\n1. Four legs is good, two is even better. ( this was shouted after some political fight and became law, when pigs walked on twos )\n2. Who walks on all fours or has wings is a friend. ( i don't remember this being changed )\n3. An animal can wear clothes. ( this was somewhere at the end or where pigs wore clothing )\n4. Resting place is important for pigs. ( i'm unsure if this was law, but i know that pigs had the privilege to beds and housing )\n5. No animal should drink alcohol without moderation. ( or something like that, when pigs begun brewing beer and starving other animals ( what an allegory for modern world's capitalism ! ) )\n6. No animal shall kill any other animal without reason. ( lol, this one was sorta funny, when the leader ( napoleon ) sentenced multiple other animals to death sentence )\n7. All animals are equal, but some are more equal. ( this one got me so bad, bro, 'more equal', that's too funny lmao )\n\nhonestly, it's funny, i hate that i love how accurately it portrays politicians\nand capitalism and shit nowadays,,\n\nanyway, i'm not going to spoil any further, but it's a nice, quick read, i'd\nsuggest, a good 8/10 :)\n\n## messaging of animal farm\n\n( this is where the spoilers end )\n\nthis got me thinking about politics and economics, today's world is sad lol\n\npolitics can be a great tool, it can be used for good, and to this day, on\nsome rare occasion, it is used for good, helping people in need and such, though\nall i usually see out of it is just publication and a good eye lol, money\nruns the world, and reputation is everything, i guess lol, it feels like politics\nnowadays is used for manipulation, privilege and wars\n\nand on the economical side, capitalism is what came up lol, it's a cool system,\ni don't think there's much else that could work better, and communism has been\nhistorically proven as ineffective, it's sad how capitalism has driven our society\n( god i hate that word sm ) into an abuse machine, it's sad how you have to abuse\nthe working class, underpaying, to make any profit, why can't the world be more peaceful\nlol, welp, it is what it is i guess,,\n\n## moving on ...\n\nanyway, back to more thoughts of mine, stress,, stress i the only word i can use to\ndescribe my life currently lol, it's nothing but that, it sucks, oh and 'jail' lol\n\nstress was already described above, why i'm feeling so stressed, and it sucks lol,\nbut it's temporary, i'll suffer for a few years, but a future is waiting for me, a future\nwhere i'm freer, happier, living in an environment i can heal from the life hurt i've\nexperienced over the years, i can finally work and build my own life, even though i'll\nbe in an abused working class, i'll be at least \"somewhere\" lol\n\nand jail, god, the lithuanian education system sucks so bad, there's zero creativity, there's\nzero true learning, i retain basically nothing from school, because there's nothing to learn,\nthey give you magical numbers, formulas, texts, and then tell you to just remember it,\ni wish it was more practical rather than what ever *this* is lol,, freedom and creativity are\nhuge values to me, and i truly feel in-jailed ( ? ) in the system, i crave for the creativity,\ni crave for learning, i crave for substance and not pure 'take this book and recite it, my disciples'\nlol, welp, once again a thing i'm hopeless at changing, i kinda have to suffer through it\nand then live freely, hopefully lol\n\nhoping to move out of this shithole someday, lithuania sucks lol, i cant describe how much i hate\nit here, people suck, economy sucks, politics suck, everything here sucks, the only redeeming\nquality of lithuania is that it has a couple of old beautiful sights, and that it isn't all\nasphalt unlike america lol, i really wanna go back to germany, as explained in <https://blog.ari.lt/b/german-days/>\nlol, but that's for the future\n\nright now, my goal and purpose is to push it through, and i've been through much worse, i'll\nsurvive this too, what's the 3 or 4 more years of suffering if i've already lived 16 years\nin it, god, i hate how emo this sounds lmao, but i mean, like, eh, it's just stupidity lol\n\ni'll get over this way of thinking one day, or not, idk, life is a confusing hard mess and i'm\nnot happy with it, i wanna change everything about it, i wanna break my life down, rip it into pieces,\nand rebuild it from scratch\n\ni'll quote my friend from a few days\n\n> you can't heal in an environment that hurt you\n\nand yeah lol, i just ew, i'll just push it through lol, like with piercings lol,\nit's so stupid to just like give up mid way through, just push it through, like with\nmy septum piercing, that was so painful, but my piercer pushed it through, it was temporary,\nand now i'm happy with it, we need some help sometimes, i guess\n\ni should really start seeing a psychiatrist again, but a good one, then a psychologist or\na therapist lol, or i'll be at this for time and time again trying to heal on my\nown, or if we use piercings as an analogy - i'll keep trying to pierce my own septum until\ni eventually can't do it and either be unhappy with everything constantly bothering me, or\ni give in and seek for a person to help me ( my piercer was so sweet i love her )\n\nwell, until i stop living in my bubble and have the resources for it, i'm stuck with just\npushing through, and idk, i can handle it, and i have my friends to support me, if anything\ni'll just have a week long mental breakdown and reset myself lol like that one time lol,\nbut mental breakdowns feel so garbage while they're happening, it's so mentally painful,\nit's horrible, but you feel good after and feel like you've let everything out of you, i need\na good mental breakdown, it'd be such a nice break from everything and an emotional reset i\nneed, but i'll keep myself together lol, the school year is almost over ( well 3 or so more motnsh\nbut still ), and then i'll get a break, i hope this summer will actually be good unlike the last\none lol\n\ni'm looking forward for next year a bit more than this, next year i'll get to pick what i want\nto study, which means it'll be a bit more engaging rather than constant pressure to learn random\npainful things, although the issue of lack of creativity and 'true learning' will still persist,\nat least i'll be engaged in the class lol\n\nliterally 1984\n\nlast week i decided to take a small break from code, i'm glad i did lol, i can't imagine\nmyself managing code stuff and working on this much school stuff at the same time, it's so much\n\n<https://github.com/ari-lt/sites.ari.lt/issues/1> states :\n\n    hey\n\n    i'm taking a little break for 2 weeks as i feel like i'm working on code 24/7 and living on the clock, i am feeling\n    very overwhelmed living with no break time, even people who are of working age get a couple of days of break,\n    while i usually don't and i feel like its about time i take a break, my week usually looks like this :\n\n    working days : energy exhausted, tired, can't work on anything\n    saturday : usually spent on code\n    sunday : test prep, school prep, stress, etc\n\n    so ye, i think i'll give myself a break because i can't lol\n\nas much as i enjoy this, i think this is a well deserved break lol, i've been going at this code stuff\nfor a while non-stop, some of it underground, private, some of it on communities like coder ( idr if that's\nthe platform name, but there was like a social media or smt for like programmers where ppl could share\ntheir code and post it ), some of it theoretical, and of course - open source stuff too, i've also done some\nwork for people, i've been the internet's tech support too, etc etc etc - there's a lot i've done with basically\nno break for years lol, but i'm probably just like seeing it like such a big thing when its probably stupid and\nnothing, its annoying, i'm constantly unsure if something is stupid or not, i wish i could think like everyone else\nbut at the same time i don't - there's no way i'd like to be the same as everyone else, but like i'd like to have\nthe aspect of knowing if something is stupid or not ( for example the break thing )\n\ni'm so given up on everything, i feel like i've just made up my own delusions that i'll push it through, that future\nis brighter, that everything i do now is stupid and pointless, or that it's important, or that something, i feel like\ni'm living in my own world and that there's two people constantly contradicting one another, but eh, until i have\nbasis to prove that my delusions are false, i'll just stay in my safe bubble lol\n\ni'm distressed, exhausted, tired, angsty, angry, in-jailed, hopeful yet hopeless, distracted, not attached to reality, delusional,\nlazy, and in need of peace - i don't know what i'm saying anymore, it feels like i'm just spitting synonyms out expecting\nit to make sense, i'm an emotional ball of angst and i can't wait until my delusions ( allegedly ) come true\n\nok, side tracking,\n\nthis nice song just begun playing and i think it's nice, y'all should check it out\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jESxRDZRSaQ>\n(  PIGBREATH - The Night Is Young (Official Music Video) ), i like it, i found it today like 2-3 hours ago and it's cool\n\nalso did y'all know that girl in red ( my beloved artist ) released a new song, it's super nice :3\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDGDDYDf5FE> ( girl in red - Too Much (Official Video) ),\ni like this song, it's playing right now,, my best friend, [casey](https://ari.lt/casey), pointed it out to me like 1 or 2 days ago\n\nwell, anyway, there's another thing bothering me - people, there's so many things that trigger me, or make my emotions\nexplode, some more than others, like there's things people trigger almost if not daily and i'm sorta used to it, even if it\ndoes hurt, i know how to control it, but some rarer ones make me explode, and it sucks, i'm learning how to control my\nemotions as it's truly a me issue lol, not as if anyone should be required to deal with my own issues and triggers, it's my\njob to ask or stay quiet and deal with it, it's very painful and annoying, but i mean, it's a me issue lol\n\n## reflection\n\ni've made so much progress from my old self lol, thinking back about my life i feel a sense of accomplishment,\nbut it's sad how much work is needed to undo everything, i'll heal once i'm out of here, i think\n\ni used to have plans of suicide and stuff, now i don't, it's damn, i thought it's set in stone, i also used to\nbe a big anorexic, i'm not as much of one anymore, still a bit shaky on that, but i'm hanging \ud83d\udc4d, i used to\nbe super unhappy with my body, i'm now unhappy with my body knowing what's wrong, that's progress i guess ? i\nused to self harm a lot, i'm repulsed by it now, i used to be scared to express myself in any way, i'm not\nas scared anymore, i also moved away from the shitty school i was in before, i'm learning how to deal with my\nemotions better, i'm also learning how to properly treat myself, i've also tried many hobbies in my life, and i've\ngotten okay at one - programming, i also like cooking to this day, i used to also be super into chemistry\nand languages, biology too iirc, music creation ( both digital and \"physical\" if it makes sense ) in general it was cool\n\nwell, i'm glad programming stayed with me, i have a lot of fun with it and it gives me the freedom, creativity, and control\ni so long for in many aspects of life, and i like cooking, it helps me to develop a healthier relationship with food,\ni am trying to not optimize for 'how low calorie can i make this' - but honestly, my brain finds it super hard to\nnot optimize for kcal count to be low, but i mean i'm not trying to make everything super low calorie on purpose\nanymore, today was like one of those rare times i made pancakes, bro pancakes - one of my biggest fears before,\nWITH NO SPINACH, like if i craved pancakes so much i would just shove a lot of spinach to fill me up rather than anything\nelse, and today i made like normal pancakes lol, it wasn't horrible but it was sorta hard to digest, ofc made with\nvegan ingredients as i'm vegan myself lol\n\ncurrently my view on food and stuff is like 'it should be satisfying and feel good', this one girl on youtube called\n<https://www.youtube.com/@ColleenChristensen> helped me understand that, maybe i'll change my view on it someday, but\nfor now that's what works for me /shrug\n\nidk, there's also personal growth, some private stuff, also self-discovery journey, etc - it's very damn\n\nthere's also some negative sides, for example i barely talk to anyone i used to talk to like 5 years ago, 5 years ago i\nused to be surrounded by like rodrigo, some tiktok friends, corbin too i think, that one girl and her emo artist friend,\nmax, those are the main ones i can recall, mainly from the lgbt support group i was in back then lol, i mean there were\nother people like noel, my best friend, which i don't talk to anymore after 10 years of friendship lol, etc etc etc lol\n\nthough i've gained other friends and stayed with others, but well, people come and go, currently, at this stage of life,\ni don't talk to many people lol, i don't really have any super close or closish bonds besides like bloody and casey, there's\nother people like joe, mike, kuran, ofc sininenkissa, other matrix people i talk to, but i wouldn't call them close bonds,\nmaybe mike, i would consider mike the closest out of that list lol, like i have connections with people, but they're never\nthat deep or close or meaningful or anything, well besides a couple, but it works for me lol, and i'm glad i'm not fully\nsocially isolated - like i sometimes go, and have went through social isolation episodes lol\n\ni've gotten better at dealing with a lot of stuff, but worse at other, i've learned to accept some things and break others\ndown, i've changed as a person, i've changed my environment, and this is probably not the first and not the last time i feel\nthis overwhelmed by change, tests, exams, life, friends, people, etc\n\n## concluding\n\ni mean i got a portion of what i wanted to get off my chest, off my chest, and i feel better now lol, i'm glad i have a\nplace like this to express myself in, share stories, and sometime look back on it, maybe not always in a positive light,\nbut it's something lol\n\nit's kinda scary to write about mental health and stuff after what happened in the past over half a year or so lol,\nbut it's over, and i'm getting over it lol\n\non a side note, [ari.lt](https://ari.lt/) matrix homeserver ( <https://blog.ari.lt/b/ariweb-matrix-homeserver/> )\nis doing great, one of the coolest things that happened to it so far, is that it got #1 places in\ntwim ( this week in matrix ) blog : <https://matrix.org/blog/2024/02/twim/#dept-of-ping-table-tennis-paddle-and-ball>\n\nso that's cool\n\nanyway thanks for giving me this opportunity to express myself, and, well, til next time :),\ncrazy roller-coaster of events and emotions we just went through lol\n\nari\n\n2024/02/20\n\nmeow meow",

      "content": "hi\n\ni just made very nice vegan tomato soup while pulling the recipe\nout of my ass, so i wanna share it and note it so i don't forget in\nthe future\n\n## ingredients\n\n- 1 onion ( cubed )\n- 1 teaspoon of dried basil\n- 2 cups of vegetable broth\n- 125 ml of coconut milk ( **update** its actually 400 or so ml, i must've misread something )\n- 800 g of canned tomatoes in juices\n- salt\n- pepper\n- 50 g of rice\n- 3 teaspoons of sugar\n- boiling hot water\n- 1 tablespoon of olive oil\n- 2 cloves of garlic ( crushed )\n\n### tools\n\n- ( immersion ) blender ( optional )\n- a medium large pot\n\n## instructions\n\ni have to prefix this section with that cooking is an art form, don't treat\nthis as exact instructions, experiment :)\n\n1. wash your rice ( might want to leave it soaking in hot water after washing if you're not using a blender )\n2. add olive oil into the pot on high heat and heat it for 3 minutes\n3. add in your onion and cook for 4-5 minutes\n4. add in your garlic and dried basil and cook for 1 minute\n5. add in your tomatoes in juices, coconut milk, vegetable broth, salt, pepper, sugar, and rice into the pot\n6. mix it and let it do its thing for 5 minutes\n7. taste it, see how's the texture and the flavour, if you want something less - add boiling water\n8. let it boil until you think it feels right, say like 10 more minutes, maybe 15\n9. take it off heat and blend it, if you don't have a blender this step is optional, or you can at least try to crush some stuff up by hand ( fork, manual potato masher or something similar )\n10. put it back on heat for 5 more minutes\n11. serve however you want it, for example with vegan grilled cheese sandwich, i personally served it with bread ( \ud83d\udc4d )\n\nbon apetit\n\n## nutritional facts\n\nthis recipe has around *4 servings*, each serving has the following nutritional facts :\n\n> % ( percent ) is in daily value : tells you how much a nutrient in a food serving contributes to a daily diet,\n> 2000 kcal is used for general nutrition advice\n\n- calories : 207 kcal\n- total fat : 7.9 g ( 10% )\n    - saturated fat : 4.2 g ( 21% )\n- cholesterol : 0 mg ( 0% )\n- sodium : 761 mg ( 33% )\n- total carbohydrate : 31g ( 11% )\n    - dietary fibre : 3.9 g ( 14% )\n    - total sugars : 13.4 g\n- protein : 4.3 g\n- vitamin d : 0 mcg ( 0% )\n- calcium : 86 mg ( 7% )\n- iron : 2 mg ( 13% )\n- potassium : 582 mg ( 12% )\n\nplease don't take these as too accurate, i'm just a 16 year old who knows how to use recipe nutrition\nanalyzers which i can find online <3",

      "content": "god i haven't done this in a while lol, since [doml 7 and 8 removal](https://blog.ari.lt/b/removal-domls-7-8/)\ni've been sorta repulsed to make domls, but time to move on lol\n\nnow as i've got some time with at least a little energy, i thought to myself\nwhy not write a doml, i really like this as i can get many things off my chest lol\n\nsince 2023/10/23 ( [doml #6](https://blog.ari.lt/b/doml-6-2023-06-27/), latest publicly available doml ) *a lot* has changed\n\nwell i'll start from the latest doml and i may remember things later on :\n\neating disorder recovery isn't going well, i am struggling lmao, it's up and down, not\nyet the rock bottom, but an collating wave, some days are fine, some days aren't, it\ndepends a lot, though we're balling, i guess\n\nexams are super near, too, english, maths, lithuanian, german, etc -- i'll be taking quite\na bit this year, then next yr i'll be taking from subjects i choose to study, and then,\nof course, the finals . it's sorta crazy how close the end of all this is, \"next year\" ( as in 2025 )\ni'll be 18, that's wild asf, currently i'm 16, this year i'll turn 17, and then in 2025 september 10 th i'll\nturn 18, which i mean as far as it may seem, is burning my skin, it's way too close for my liking\nand i just know that 2025 is going to be a ***very shit*** year for me, but welp, quite overwhelming,\nbut i'll manage, not as if i wasn't through hard times before, but welp -- there's more important\nthings in life than my angsty emotional teenage thoughts, but i like sharing them\n\nthen, as mentioned, annual school project, i picked psychology, and actually it isn't going too\nbad, i was super worries about it in doml #6, yet now i don't see it as a big deal lol, the biggest\nthing for me now is the exams, the project is just a project, we've ( me and my teammate ) have\nalready collected 50% of the required results, i predict we'll have anywhere from 200 to 350\nentries to use for statistics, i have [made some parts open source](https://ari.lt/gh/annual-school-project-23-24)\nand i'll publish more parts of it ( excluding the results, of course ) once i'm done possibly,\ni don't like working and not being able to help anyone, who knows -- maybe someone in the future\nwill find it useful /shrug, though the full open sourcing is going to take a bit as i'll basiacally\nneed to re-do it with fake data as i don't want to expose any actual data lol\n\ni've also mentioned 'at 06/09-10 i worked on painting my laptop lol' in the 6 th doml,\nwell, speadking of laptops, i got new hardware around 7 months ago and gave the old one\nto my stepfather,, i had to run arch linux for a bit as mediatek sucks, but now i've replaced\nthe mt7902 with an intel ax210, works like a charm, and now i am back on my beloved gentoo &gt;3 -- one more\nupgrade is awaiting -- from 8 gb of ram to 16, very soon :3\n\nthough, now after responding to dml #6 -- what's now ?\n\ni'll be using [my blog](https://blog.ari.lt/) as the main resource for remembering things in sorta chronological\norder\n\nwell, 1000 days of ari-web happened, so did 3 years of ari-web, wild that i've been working on this\nfor over 3 years lol, and that's only ari-web, it's kinda nice how i've been programming for like\nhalf my life, i mean there's many people who say \"it's a waste of time\" or something, but like lol,\nit's stupid and it makes me mad lol,, there's nothing that makes me feel happy, fulfilled, and accomplished\nas programming does, it's like an art -- just with text,, just like writing books or building a sculpture,\nit's just like, idk, i really enjoy it and it's my passion, and i believe that it's time well-spent,\neven if \"i don't make any money from it\" - quoting at least 3 people i have in mind at the moment of writing,\nbut i wouldn't have it any other way, i love creating stuff, solving problems\n( \"oH ? dOEs iT sOlvE wORlD hUngER ??\" - also quoting one or two people )\nand generally having fun with it . i don't get why people try to strip away this fun from me, it's like\nthey only see the world as purely problems such as social issues with zero logical problems involved\nand that the only goal in life is money - it sucks . oh well though, not as if i can change their view\nno matter how much i explain myself, though at this point i don't feel the need to explain it, i'm just\nover it, it's what i like to do and what i do, and who are *you* to take it away from me ?\nand i've also heard complaints about how i spend around 100 euro a year on my whole programming things\n( mainly vps and domain ), i just pay for the ability to host my applications freely, let people use\nthe vps, have a backup server, etc,, it's just 100 euro a year, while it brings me a lot of joy,\nopportunities, and ability to support other open source creators\n\nwell anyway, that rant aside : i've also switched from the xiaomi android rom ( which sucks ***A LOT*** )\nto lineageos ( great rom imho ) and i've made a guide on it :\n<https://blog.ari.lt/b/install-lineageos-root-ur-xiomi-redmi-8-phone-using-magisk/>\ni feel nothing but regret by staying on that shitty rom for ***4 years*** lol, but i'm glad\ni've switched\n\nlooks like i've also rewrote the blogging system ?? that's epic asf, i forget what i work on sometimes\nand this is definitely an epic change, the old one needed a rewrite and the current one is actually\nfaster which is, in fact, very cool :)\n\ngod, the <https://blog.ari.lt/b/removal-domls-7-8/> post brings me flashbacks, i get huge ptsd ( to the\npoint where i jump from sleep ) because of things that happened during this period, it made me miserable,\nnow i've moved on, ptsd still persists though :/\n\nafter that i've gotten into vps stuff, begun maining matrix as my main form of communication and\ni am so glad i've moved on, i not only met quite a few cool people, but now i also have the ability to provide\nservices to people, let them host their own things, etc -- it's great, and i'm glad to help people and\nexpand upon my opportunities, i'm glad i'm growing up, though i'm scared of it, though it's nice being\nmore and more independent as time goes ( btw wanna join the homeserver yourself ? [join ari.lt here](https://ari.lt/matrix) )\n\nregardless, though, these are only events which i've published before . there's many things i can't really\ntalk about publicly, which i wish to, but i cannot, though i'll share the things that i can share, though\nonly in semi-chronological order :\n\ni got quite a few other piercings which is cool :3 like over the past months i've been getting\npiercings, as i've gotten the chance to, and it's been great, i've gotten my long waited for piercings\nand some i've begun wanting fairly recently -- i think i'll enjoy this while i can, it's nice and if\nanything i can just take them out lol\n\nnext year i'm going to be an 11 th grader, i honestly can't wait for this, i will finally get to study\nwhat i want and what i am actually good at, not shit like chemistry which i not only dislike, i am also\nnot that good at it, but ye, it's exciting, and in general -- i want to move on from my class, even though\ni don't really face many issues there, there's a few people i dislike and it'd be nice to just have\nanother class, and in general -- i'd like to reverse the past year or so of my life, well, at least some\nparts of it, i'd like to start from another point, but what's done is done and now you cannot erase it\n\ni'm also moving out soon, which is pretty cool, well, 'soon', it's probably going to still take some\ntime as everything's is still being set up, but i'm moving and i wonder how that's going to be like,\nthough stuff like that ( change ) makes me super anxious, so i'm interested, yet still super anxious\n\ni also just remember once talking about pe making me super anxious and stuff, since last yr ( second half )\ni haven't done any pe or anything, and honestly -- it's great,, whatever exercise i need i get from walking around\nand stuff, and as i don't need to change or anything like that, i don't feel as miserable at school and stuff, which is\ngreat, though that doesn't mean school's a non-miserable place lol : work, some people, exams, stress,\ncomparing ( others comparing you for example, total shit ass ), etc is just all garbage, especially\nas even if i try to make school less miserable i get shut down right away, told i'm annoying, and that sorta\njust breaks my heart lol, welp though lol\n\nhonestly, i thought my life's going better, now as i'm reflecting on it, even from stuff i can't share,\ngod, i still got so much progress to do, though that also means i'm not as blind to issues i've faced\nbefore and that i can at least start the first steps to life quality improvement -- acknowledgement\n\nthough, overall, the message i'm trying to say : i want my time back\n\nthough, i think i'll stop here before i overshare xD, goodbye, good luck, and speciate your\ntime while you can - cya in the next post\n\nari, 2024/01/29",

      "description": "tutorial walking through setting up dendrite matrix homeserver with nginx ( together with certbot ) on linux ( in this case, specifically debian 12, but works everywhere ), also covers very annoying errors i've encountered making my own matrix homeserver -- matrix.ari.lt / ari.lt",
      "content": "hello\n\nrecently i've set up a [matrix server](https://blog.ari.lt/b/ariweb-matrix-homeserver/)\nand i went through a lot of pain, so i'm here to document issues\ni've faced and hopefully i can help more people set up their homeservers\nquicker and with less issues\n\nalso, before we start, i want to clarify that all commands that start with `#`\nmust be ran as the root user ( for example through `sudo` or `su` ), and `$`\nshould be ran as normal user ( for example `matrix` or `user` or something ),\nunless stated otherwise\n\n## setup\n\n-   [debian](https://debian.org/) 12\n-   [contabo VPS](https://contabo.com/en/vps/) S SSD\n    -   8 gb RAM\n    -   4 cores\n    -   200 gb SSD\n    -   200 Mbit/s network speed\n-   [dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) implementation of the [matrix protocol](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/)\n-   [golang](https://go.dev/) `1.20.0` and up\n\ni wouldn't suggest going below the contabo VPS S SSD hardware-level because it may\nget slow and painful, especially when joining bigger rooms, i'd even suggest going\nwith contabo VPS M SSD, which is why i'll upgrade soon\n\n## delegation of the main domain\n\ni assume you won't be running your website ( say like <https://ari.lt/> ) on the same\nserver you run your matrix server, in my case, i actually even couldn't because of how\nmy website is hosted on netlify and ye, but regardless, i'd very much suggest running\nmatrix ( dendrite )\n\ni personally went for the [.well-known delegation](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html#well-known-delegation) method, but you can go for anything you like as there's multiple methods\n\nhere's how my .well-known stuff looks :\n\n`.well-known/matrix/client` :\n\n    {\n        \"m.homeserver\": {\n            \"base_url\": \"https://matrix.ari.lt\"\n        }\n    }\n\n`.well-known/matrix/server` :\n\n    {\n        \"m.server\": \"matrix.ari.lt:443\"\n    }\n\nas seen at <https://ari.lt/git>, they also don't have to be pretty-printed, i don't\nknow why i made them pretty, but it's fine\n\nfew key notes :\n\n-   do not forget the port in `.well-known/matrix/server`, it is not implicit,\n    i don't remember the default port, but prefer to be explicit\n-   the files must point to your matrix server ( where dendrite will be hosted )\n-   make sure that the files return `Content-Type` header as JSON, aka `application/json`\n-   make sure CORS is set up correctly\n    -   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` = `*`\n    -   `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` = `GET`\n\nthis is the easy part\n\n## golang\n\nbefore anything, we will need to install golang, on debian you can do `apt install go-golang`, but that\nmay install an old version of go, which isn't desirable, here's how i did it :\n\n-   went to <https://go.dev/dl/>\n-   downloaded the latest package for linux ( in my case <https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz> )\n-   followed the [go installation instructions from package](https://go.dev/doc/install)\n\nthis gave me the latest go language compiler, which we will use to compile dendrite as it's\nwritten in go\n\n## installing other dependencies\n\nother dependencies are defined in <https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/planning#dependencies>, but\nat the moment they're :\n\n-   go ( already covered in <#:golang> )\n-   postgresql database\n-   built-in [NATS server](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) ( we don't need to do anything here, dendrite comes with one )\n-   reverse proxy, such as [nginx](https://nginx.org/), which we will use in this case\n\nand for SSL stuff we will also add `certbot` to our dependencies so we could have a\nsecure SSL connection\n\nto install them, you can run the following :\n\n    # apt install postgresql postgresql-client nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n\n-   `postgresql` and `postgresql-client` for postgresql dependency and interface\n-   `nginx` as our reverse proxy\n-   `certbot` and `python3-certbot-nginx` for SSL things\n\n## preparing database\n\npreparing the database is fairly easy as per\n[the matrix dendrite database setup](https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/manual/database)\n\nfirstly, you need to start and enable the postgresql service :\n\n    # systemctl enable --now postgresql\n\nnext, run the following to switch to postgresql control user :\n\n    # su postgres\n    $ cd\n\nnow you should be in the postgres user's home dir, now you will\nhave to create the role for dendrite, set its password and create\nits database, but before, i have to warn you to create a password\nsuch as it shouldn't include non-url-safe characters, else it may\nbe a pain to configure dendrite in the future, this is why i'd recommend\nyou just generate the password using the following command :\n\n    $ head -n 16 /dev/urandom | base64 -w 0 | shuf | sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9]//g' | head -c 123\n\nand then using these commands to create the role, set its password and create the database :\n\n    $ createuser -P dendrite\n    $ createdb -O dendrite -E UTF-8 dendrite\n\nnow you're all set with the database\n\n## compiling dendrite\n\nfirstly, let's set up the user we'll run dendrite on, it is a good practice\nto run applications such as this under lowest possible privileges so we don't\nrun into nasty attacks in the future, here's how you do it :\n\nrun the following command\n\n    # useradd -m matrix\n\nthis will create a new user called `matrix` with its own `/home/matrix/` directory,\nwe will run dendrite under this user,, next -- set the password for the user :\n\n    # passwd matrix\n\nmake sure to use a secure password, may i recommend [pwdtools](https://ari.lt/gh/pwdtools) ? though you can use anything\n\nyou may also want to run this to make the home directory of this user only readable by that user :\n\n    $ chmod 700 -R /home/matrix/\n\nbut it's optional\n\nthen, switch to the matrix user, you can use any user to do this :\n\n    $ su matrix\n\nnow as you're the `matrix` user, you should go into your `~` ( home )\ndirectory :\n\n    $ cd\n\nnow as you're the matrix user in its home direcotory,\ndownload the latest release tarball ( `.tar.gz` )\noff <https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/latest> and extract it\n\nat the moment for me it's\n<https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/archive/refs/tags/v0.13.5.tar.gz>\nso i'll assume the same, although for future readers --\n**please grab the latest version**, here's an example of how to download it and\nextract it :\n\n    $ curl -fLO https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/archive/refs/tags/v0.13.5.tar.gz\n    $ tar xvf v0.13.5.tar.gz\n    $ cd dendrite-0.13.5/\n\nnow you should end up in the latest release of dendrite\n\naccording to <https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/manual/build>\nyou should now run the following :\n\n    $ go build -o bin/ ./cmd/...\n\nkeep in mind it's LITERALLY `go build -o bin/ ./cmd/...`\nand not for example `go build -o bin/ ./cmd/*`, it's a literal\nelipsis, run the command as-is with the 3 dots as go is weird\nand quirky like that i guess\n\nthis should build dendrite, keep in mind this will be network\nand resource heavy\n\nnow you can install it :\n\n    $ go install ./cmd/dendrite\n\nand your dendrite installation should end up in `~/go/bin/dendrite` :)\n\n## signing keys\n\nnow, you will generate signing keys for your matrix encryption, which will be used\nin authentication of federation requests\n[as explained here, the tutorial for setting up keys in dendrite](https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/manual/signingkeys)\n\nrun the following command in the dendrite directory ( the one you ran commands in <#:compiling dendrite> ) :\n\n    $ ./bin/generate-keys --private-key matrix_key.pem\n\n**never share this key with anyone**\n\n## configuring dendrite\n\nthis part is based off [my own config of dendrite](https://ari.lt/lh/matrix.ari.lt), which\nis set up by help of people, my own research and [the setup docs](https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/manual/configuration),\nkeep up-to-date with my configuration and the docs as this section\nmay get outdated, although i'll do my best to keep this up to date\nas long as i run the ari-web matrix server\n\nfirstly copy the example config :\n\n    $ cp dendrite-sample.yaml dendrite.yaml\n\nand now, open it in your favourite text editor, such as `vim` for example, maybe `nano` even :\n\n    $ vim dendrite.yaml\n\nnow, i will cover only some parts of the config which you may want to change,\nbut also the default config includes a lot of comments, so you may want to\nlook through all of it and see what you want or don't\n\n`global` :\n\n-   `server_name` -- this should be the domain you are delegating from, for example `ari.lt`\n    has the `.well-known` delegation to `matrix.ari.lt` so the value of `server_name` will be `ari.lt`\n-   `database.connection_string` -- this is the connection string of your postgresql database,\n    this should be a url as follows : `postgresql://dendrite:<password>@127.0.0.1/dendrite`, replace `<password>`\n    with your password, for example `postgresql://dendrite:password123@127.0.0.1/dendrite`\n-   `well_known_server_name` and `well_known_client_name` -- these two keys should have\n    the same value of `https://<your matrix domain>:443`, for example `https://matrix.ari.lt:443`, the\n    domain must be the same as your matrix server, not delegated domain ( so `matrix.ari.lt` and not `ari.lt` )\n-   make sure `disable_federation` is set to `false`\n-   `presence.*` -- set all keys that are `false` to `true`, if you want presence to be a thing\n    ( such as typing, online status, etc ), this is optional\n\n`client_api` :\n\n-   i'd suggest setting `registration_disabled` and `guests_disabled` to `true` so you'd have full\n    control over what people have accounts, if you want open registrations you may want to set both\n    of them to `false` or just `registration_disabled` to `false`, depending on your wants, you will\n    be able to create new accounts using `./bin/create-account` later on regardless\n-   if you disabled registrations, you'll need to set `registration_shared_secret` to some value,\n    you can use the password generator command from before -- `head -n 16 /dev/urandom | base64 -w 0 | shuf | sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9]//g' | head -c 123`\n    to generate something good enough\n-   you may also want to set `rate_limiting.exempt_user_ids` to yourself ( like `@ari:ari.lt` as an example ),\n    maybe even change the rate limiting in general\n\n`sync_api` :\n\n-   set the `real_ip_header` to `X-Real-IP`, we will use this in the future\n-   if you want search functionality, you may want to set `search.enable` to `true`\n\n`user_api` :\n\n-   if you'll have / already have a main / lounge room, you may want to add it to `auto_join_rooms`, like `#root:ari.lt` for example\n\nthat's pretty much it with the configuration of dendrite, although i'd still suggest going through all config options\nat least once and thinking if you want them or not :)\n\n## running dendrite\n\nto run dendrite you can just run\n\n    $ ~/go/bin/dendrite -config ./dendrite.yaml\n\nand if you want to run it in the background you just run this :\n\n    $ ~/go/bin/dendrite -config ./dendrite.yaml & disown\n\nsimple as that, now dendrite will be listening on port 8008\n\n## dns records\n\nthe `A` record is required\n\n    matrix.yourdomain.tld 3600 IN A        <server ip>\n    matrix.yourdomain.tld 3600 IN CAA 0 issue <issuer>\n\nyou may remove `CAA` if you disable all the fancy SSL stuff in nginx\n( which we're about to configure )\n\nyou can also optionally add `AAAA` for ipv6 support\n\nfor ari-web i've set it up like this :\n\n    matrix.ari.lt 3600 IN A            62.171.174.136\n    matrix.ari.lt 3600 IN CAA 0 issue letsencrypt.org\n\n## configuring nginx\n\n**tldr** <#:final nginx config>\n\nin our case we will use nginx as our reverse proxy, this i will base off\n[my own nginx config for my vps](https://us.ari.lt/git/blob/main/res/nginx.conf)\n\nfirstly, you need to make sure if either user `www-data` or `http` exists, you can do that\nby running\n\n    $ cat /etc/passwd\n\nwhich will show you all users\n\nif none do, run\n\n    # useradd www-data  # or http\n\nafter that, make sure that `/etc/nginx/mime.types` exists :\n\n    $ ls /etc/nginx/mime.types\n\nif not, run the following command :\n\n    # curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx/master/conf/mime.types -fLo /etc/nginx/mime.types\n\nnow, open up `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` in your favourite text editor and configure it :\n\n    # vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nwe will start by setting up some base rules :\n\n    user www-data;\n    worker_processes auto;\n    pid /run/nginx.pid;\n    worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;\n\n    events {\n        use epoll;\n        multi_accept on;\n        worker_connections 4096;\n    }\n\nmake sure to replace `www-data` with `http` if you're using the `http` user instead,\nhere's what this piece of config means :\n\n-   `user www-data;` will make sure that the worker processes run under a low privilege user\n    such as `www-data`\n-   `worker_processes auto;` makes the worker process count optimal for your cpu\n    core count, each worker than handle thousands of connections\n-   `pid /run/nginx.pid;` specifies the file where the server will write its master process id\n-   `worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;` sets the limit of maximum number of file descriptors opened by this process ( every connection is a unix socket, so also a file descriptor )\n-   `use epoll;` sets the method to use to get notifications for network events, `epoll` is particularly good for linux\n-   `multi_accept on;` allows to handle multiple simultaneous connections\n-   `worker_connections 4096;` sets the limit of maximum number of connections per worker\n\nnext, we'll set up some basic config for our server :\n\n    http {\n        include mime.types;\n        default_type application/octet-stream;\n\n        access_log off;\n\n        tcp_nopush on;\n        tcp_nodelay on;\n        keepalive_timeout 120;\n        types_hash_max_size 2048;\n        server_names_hash_bucket_size 256;\n\n        sendfile on;\n    }\n\nyou can dig into this config deeper, but abstractly :\n\n-   `default_type application/octet-stream;` sets the default mime type to `application/octet-stream` ( binary data )\n-   `access_log off;` turns off the access log so we don't log requests and their IPs\n-   sets up some TCP options\n-   sets `types_hash_max_size`, it's the mime type hash table size, this is for different types of mime types for different files as matrix also works on file uploading\n-   `server_names_hash_bucket_size 256;` is for server directives, how much memory it's allowed to use\n-   `sendfile on;` is for file uploads\n\nnow, we can set up a basic `server` :\n\n    http {\n        ...\n\n        server {\n            listen 80;\n            listen [::]:80;\n\n            server_name matrix.yourdomain.tld;\n\n            access_log off;\n\n            return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;\n        }\n\n        server {\n            listen 443 ssl;\n            listen [::]:443 ssl;\n\n            listen 8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n            listen [::]:8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n\n            server_name matrix.yourdomain.tld;\n\n            access_log off;\n        }\n    }\n\nhere you can also now start nginx :\n\n    # systemctl enable --now nginx\n\nthis sets up the basic requirements for a server, make sure to\nreplace yourdomain.tld / matrix.yourdomain.tld with whatever your\npreferred domain is, 443 is the https ( tls ) port and 8448 is the secure\nfederation port,, this is where we have to take a step back,\nsave our nginx config and move on for a little bit\n\n### tls ( https )\n\nto set up tls ( https ) on our server now, we will have to run this command :\n\n    certbot certonly --nginx\n\nand follow the directions on the screen\n\nnow, as you have that set up, you can continue setting up your proxy, add SSL stuff :\n\n    http {\n        ...\n\n        server {\n            listen 443 ssl;\n            listen [::]:443 ssl;\n\n            listen 8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n            listen [::]:8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n\n            server_name matrix.yourdomain.tld;\n\n            access_log off;\n\n            ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/matrix.yourdomain.tld/fullchain.pem;\n            ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/matrix.yourdomain.tld/privkey.pem;\n            ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/matrix.yourdomain.tld/fullchain.pem;\n\n            ssl_stapling on;\n            ssl_stapling_verify on;\n            ssl_session_timeout 1d;\n            ssl_session_cache shared:MozSSL:10m;\n            ssl_session_tickets off;\n            ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n            ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256';\n            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n        }\n    }\n\nno, we dont need to touch the `:80` one, that will always stay the same as it'll just redirect to https\n\ni won't explain these options, but basically only two lines of SSL things are required :\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/matrix.yourdomain.tld/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/matrix.yourdomain.tld/privkey.pem;\n\nother stuff is sanity and security, i won't dig deep into it but basically this enables\n[ssl stapling](https://knowledge.digicert.com/quovadis/ssl-certificates/ssl-general-topics/what-is-ocsp-stapling)\nand also sets up some secure preferred ciphers so we know that secure encryption is happening\nat all times\n\nif you didn't choose to use the `CAA` record you may use only those two lines instead of all those `ssl_*`\nconfigurations\n\nand now, you are done setting ssl up on nginx\n\n### after ssl ( https )\n\nnow, we add our locations :\n\n    http {\n        ...\n\n        server {\n            listen 443 ssl;\n            listen [::]:443 ssl;\n\n            listen 8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n            listen [::]:8448 ssl http2 default_server;\n\n            server_name matrix.yourdomain.tld;\n\n            ...\n\n            location = / {\n                access_log off;\n                return 301 https://$server_name/_matrix/static/;\n            }\n\n            location ~ ^(/_matrix|/_synapse/client) {\n                access_log off;\n\n                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8008;\n\n                proxy_http_version 1.1;\n\n                proxy_set_header Host $host;\n                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n\n                client_max_body_size 512M;\n                proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;\n                proxy_buffering off;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n`location = /` sets up the `/` location of your server, it'll always redirect to\nthe dendrite static page so once you visit `matrix.yourdomain.tld`, it'll always\nredirect to the welcome page, so it doesn't look as boring, although you can just\nremove that, it's optional\n\nnow `location ~ ^(/_matrix|/_synapse/client)` is where the actual federation stuff happens,\nas always we turn off the access log and we pass our requests to our local dendrite instance\nrunning on port `8008` and then set up the following things :\n\n-   always set the http version to 1.1\n-   set a couple of headers ( such as `X-Real-IP` from before, this is used for multiple things )\n-   `client_max_body_size 512M;` states that the accepted body of a client cannot exceed 512 megabytes,\n    you can increase or decrease the size, this is only ever an issue in file uploads\n-   `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;` sets the maximum size of a temp file, keeping it `0` disables the\n    buffering, which means the content coming FROM the proxy directly to the user, if not this\n    breaks downloads in matrix and makes it so they break and only partially deliver something\n-   `proxy_buffering off;` this is like `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0` but instead its TO user not FROM user\n\n## final nginx config\n\nafter all this work we end up with a config something like :\n\n    user www-data;\n    worker_processes auto;\n    pid /run/nginx.pid;\n    worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;\n\n    events {\n        use epoll;\n        multi_accept on;\n        worker_connections 4096;\n    }\n\n    http {\n        include mime.types;\n        default_type

now save the file and quit the editor, also, a tip : avoid gzip compression, it kills performance\nand cpu on your vps, it's painful, stick to vanilla\n\nyou can also add this to `http` block to enable [HSTS preload](https://scotthelme.co.uk/hsts-preloading/)\nwith which you can apply to [hstspreload.org](https://hstspreload.org/) :\n\n    http {\n        ...\n\n        add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload\";\n\n        ...\n    }\n\n## finalizing\n\nnow, after all this your matrix server is almost done, all you have to do is :\n\nlog into the matrix user :\n\n    $ su matrix\n\nchange to its home :\n\n    $ cd\n\nkill dendrite :\n\n    $ pkill -f dendrite\n\nrestart nginx\n\n    # systemctl restart nginx\n\nrestart dendrite :\n\n    $ ~/go/bin/dendrite -config ./dendrite.yaml & disown\n\n## sanity check\n\nnow, as everything is up and running, make sure everything's okay by going to\n`matrix.yourdomain.tld`, it should show you the dendrite index page, if it doesn't,\nplease verify everything and make sure everything's okay\n\nif you cannot figure it out, you can come and ask in\n[#root:ari.lt](https://matrix.to/#/#root:ari.lt) or [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org)\n\n## new user\n\nnow, as everything works, you can log in as the matrix user and create a new account for yourself by\ngoing into the directory which you built dendrite in ( the one with `bin/` directory in it )\nand run this :\n\n    $ ./bin/create-account --config dendrite.yaml -username some_username -admin\n\nthis will prompt you for a password, dendrite doesn't seem to like passwords over 72 characters,\nso make sure it fits\n\nyou can also create normal user accounts by doing :\n\n    $ ./bin/create-account --config dendrite.yaml -username some_username\n\naka removing the `-admin` argument\n\nnow, you can log in with your [favourite matrix client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/)\nsuch as for example [schildi](https://schildi.chat/)\nor [element](https://element.io/), have fun\n\n## concluding\n\ni hope i could help at least a little, it took me a while to figure out issues, solve problems,\nfind answers and come up with my own solutions, ask people, debug, etc etc etc\n\na lot of trouble went into this and i hope this popped up in your search engine whenever you're looking\nto solve such issues as :\n\n-   how to set up dendrite on nginx properly and securely\n-   dendrite matrix implementation on nginx not sending the full file / image ( partial send and then stream close )\n    -   main config options in <#:final nginx config> to look out for would be\n        -   `types_hash_max_size 2048;`\n        -   `server_names_hash_bucket_size 256;`\n        -   `sendfile on;`\n        -   `client_max_body_size 512M;`\n        -   `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;`\n        -   `proxy_buffering off;`\n-   failing to sync data in ( android ) clients on dendrite matrix instance\n    -   still unsure why web works, but i think it's related to it not sending full files\n-   how to properly delegate a matrix domain\n-   why am i getting `M_UNRECOGNIZED` in dendrite matrix server\n    -   probably because you have forwarding set up badly, make sure to not have just `location /` for example\n-   why am i getting request signature errors in dendrite matrix server in nginx\n    -   also related to the `M_UNRECOGNIZED` problem, make sure to not overgeneralize the location, use `location ~ ^(/_matrix|/_synapse/client)`\n-   generally setup errors and issues with setting up dendrite with nginx and ssl\n\n## related error messages\n\n( just in case someone decides to look them up and

      "description": "some stories about my days spent in germany which i feel extremely nostalgic for, no matter how traumatizing it was to be there, i miss it and i'd choose it over lithuania any hour of the day lol",
      "content": "i was talking with my friend about stuff and i remembered the days when i used to live\nin germany, i miss it, i have bad nostalgia feeling because of it, even though the story\nwas kinda traumatizing, at least how it ended, while it lasted it wasn't the prettiest\nby itself, it was better than the ending lol\n\n## beginnings\n\nwell, the travel to germany was cool\n\nbefore the trip i had my stuff packed like a week prior and the last day in my village / town\ni spent with a couple of people, before i had to go, then some guy picked us up by car\nand we went to klaip\u0117da, i remember going into the ship and the stairs and hallway and whatnot,\ni remember the sheer size of it\n\ni remember the ship and the cabin i stayed in with\nmy family, i brought all my stuff to the cabin and whatnot, that day i also tried toblerone\nor whatever that chocolate is called for the first time, i payed like 5 euro for it \ud83d\udc80\n\ni also remember watching despicable me and stuff on my stepfather's at the time laptop,\nnot only that, also spongebob i think, but it was basically an animated film night for me,\nthe trip took just around 2 days if i remember correctly, i remember before the trip was\nover we ate at the cafe and before the ship came to the port, we went and watched it, but\nthis brings me back to the trip, my parents got drunk and went out to the shore to smoke and\nshit, and it was slippery and dark there, so like imagine small me left with an even smaller\nbrother on a ship with people whose language we don't speak and i don't have my documents and\nwhatnot, i'd be very confused on what to do, although i think my english skills at the time\nwould've helped me at least a bit, but yeah, i was scared for that, it all went fine though\n\ni remember then going off the ship, some lithuanian lady helped us to get off the ship as we had\nmany bags, my mother made a comment about her walking very fast and the lady got angry, i felt\nbad, but oh well, we got off the ship safely and were in germany\n\nwe ported off not far from a bus stop, which is where we went, i got a diet coke there on a\nvending machine, we left at 18:00 or so and we were heading somewhere, i don't really remember how\nit worked, but iirc we were dropped off next to a train station in kiel, which is where my\nstepfather's at the time friend picked us up by his car\n\ni remember going home then, watching the stuff outside, i remember us passing a bridge iirc,\ni can't fully recall it, but i remember the moment we were dropped off next to home, the grass\nwas very outgrown in the yard, i remember us going up the small stairs up to our apartment\nand me checking it out, then we didn't have anything there, not even beds, it was empty\n\nwell, i was lucky that day, because in germany we had days where people would put out free\nstuff to take outside, and me, along with my mother and brother, went on a walk, and found a\ngood closet or commode or something of sort then and i was given it to use it for mine and my\nbrother's things ( clothing and ofc my autistic hoard of things ), i can't recall if i had my\nlittlest brother yet, but possibly, but even if he existed at the time, he probably wasn't\nold enough to do much\n\nin the evening we also got beds, i can't recall how we got them, but we got them, i got the one\nnext to the outlet and window, next to my balcony door and my brother got one closer to the door,\nand my littlest brother, if he existed even, probably slept with my parents\n\ni remember how long i used to stay up in germany, my sleep was fully fucked, i used to go to bed\nat like 5 am and birds used to chirp and whatnot lol and only then i used to go to bed, and then wake\nup at 15:00 or so, probably watching youtube or something\n\nafter some time we got used to the life in germany, my sleep got better and we discovered and picked\nout main places to be, for example the kebab place, or the main store we used to go to, i remember\nus buying popsicles which was like fruit and it had a tip dipped in something which had like popping candy\non it, maybe it was like white coloured chocolate ? i can't recall much about it, but i remember that\nit was like 20 popsicles a box, if i could find it i'd show you, but i can't find it, i also recall the pond\nand the 2 supermarkets we used to go, the football field next to the kindergarten, which was next to some\nbig building and a bridge and stuff, it was cool\n\nanyway, i also remember a couple of stories from tht period\n\n## story 1\n\none day i remember my parents giving me a mental breakdown as it used to b their hobby basically, seeing\nhow far they can push my psyche til i break and then watch me melt down, i think they found\npleasure in mentally torturing me lol, well at the time it got so bad the cops even came, or something of\nsort ? i remember cops did come and were in our yard or somewhere close, but i can't recall if they\ncame to our home or not, but basically forced me to shut up lmfao, i was breaking down hard and it\nwas just `no`, but welp, that story didn't stick with me much, i just remember that my room got fucked\nup by me and people didn't take it lightly\n\n## story 2\n\nin kiel we used to live in a rented apartment and the home wasn't ours technically, we just lived there\nand payed money for it\n\none day the landlord said that some guy is going to come to check for pipes or something, and the dude\ncame, and as i was the only person who knew english then, i was forced to talk, the guy was talking about\npipes and how he needs to check them, the landlord told my parents to not let him, but i said 'yeah go ahead'\nas i didn't know any better, i was confused anyway\n\nanyway when i came home, i remember my mother screaming at me for stuttering and being anxious about it\nand letting him check the pipes, the dude pulled up google translate and my mother pressed english\nbro i wanted to pick lithuanian so her dumbass could understand what he was saying because i didn't know\nhow to reply, like bruh, i can't with her these days nor back then\n\n## story 3\n\nback in germany i had like a telescope thing and i used to do star watching when the sky used to be clear,\nit was nice, what made it shit was that my parents used to be drunk there 24/7 and in germany it isnt socially\nacceptable to have your children around in such condition, so i remember a story when i was star watching and\nwe got screamed at by some person\n\nwell none of us except one guy knew german and the guy said it was a threat abt police bc there were children\nout with them or something, i can't recall it well lol, but welp, then i went to my balcony to watch stars\n\n## story 4\n\nthis story is basically the ending of my adventures in germany\n\none day my stepfather at the time got crazy and wanted to kill us, i was in panic, because of course\ni was, i wasn't going to go down to some random alcoholic who abused me just as my mother did, bro\ntried to break my leg once even, but anyway, i was once again the target of the whole thing and\nhad to proxy everything to them as they didn't know any english and still don't to this day\n\ni had to call police, 2 times, i remember calling the police and panicking, the lady on the phone\nasked me to calm down and tell them the address and explain the situation and whatnot calmly, which\nwas hard when ur stepfather is trying to get u fucked over in a country you don't know the language\nof and are new to it lol\n\nthe first time, police warned him and left, the 2 nd time he was taken away to police and only came\nback a day later, at that point the pot water i had boiling was aggressively boiling because i was\nprepared to use it to burn him if anything lol, this whole thing lasted a good while lol, after that\nhe came back home and it was awkward, we moved out, but it wasn't as simple as just moving out lol,\nit was many fights, problems, funding issues, etc\n\ni remember the stepfather refused to pay for tickets to all of the members, he only was going to buy\ntickets for his children lol, i am not included and nor is my mother ofc, so we couldn't, but i don't\neven think he did that, his friend paid for our tickets back to lithuania and even took us to the port\nall for free when we had to put our stuff in trash bags as we didn't have much else\n\nbefore leaving germany, i remember going to the store one last time and buying some snacks for the trip,\nit was like a snacks kit, it was cheap and was better than nothing, we didn't have much money then\n\ni remember going by ship and the food for kids from the cafeteria was free or cheap or something like that,\nwe were hungry and we ate, the ship also had a playground area we used to play with kids in, it had a tv too,\nso it was a cool place to spend time when you can't afford mobile data for example, those 2 days were painful,\nbut we got back to lithuania, where my mothers friend picked us up from klaip\u0117da and took us back to\nour village / town\n\ni remember hanging out in the train or bus stop, seeing sky scraper( s ) there and whatnot, it was pretty\nboring to wait there for hours, esp as a child lol, nothing to do basically, i drew stuff, walked around the stop,\nmaybe, if i had games on my phone, played those, til the friend came\n\nthe friend's car was crowded asf and it was painful, but in a bit we were back home, back to a basically\ncompletely empty house with nothing but my cat in it and a weird looking spider and spider web in the toilet\nwhich i got scared of when i went to the toilet, nor us nor my grandma had much money at the time so we\nwere struggling for a good while, but it got sorted out after some time, we unpacked our things, set up what\nwe had left at home and ye, i remember once my grandma making us like waffles out of corn or something ?\nit was probably the best meal i had that month, but i was struggling with eating at the time too anyway so it\nwasn't much of a surprise\n\nbut eh, slowly got back to the life of a lithuanian and it all got sorted out i think, back to the lithuanian\ndream of pure bdsm misery was back as i was back at the old town i was in with the old people and old ways of\nthinking and everything as it was -- shit\n\n## nostalgia\n\nbut welp, compared to germany, lithuania is a total shithole and i miss it a lot, i hope i get to visit kiel\none more time someday and take a walk there or something, maybe i will, but who knows, im extremely nostalgic\nfor everything there even though i've spent most of my life in lithuania, just as i am now, i want to go\nthere and experience it all again regardless of the trauma, because that shortwhile was nice, i'd like to not\nrepeat the trauma but to actually solidly live there and exist amongst germans which from own experience\nare sane and nice people, germany also has good laws and economy, it just seems like a great country overall\nand maybe i'll get to re-experience something like this again someday\n\nmaybe even find the time capsule i planted when i was there, i remember putting an sd card in it too and\nit had stuff in it, idk what else i put there, but i do remember the sd card, i'm a memory hoarder\nand i am just painfully angsty that i can't review it or know what it is, what i put on there and experience\nthe culture of kiel once again\n\nit's so annoying and so nostalgic, but at the same time has so much trauma attached to it, so many fights\nand generally it was shit, but the country itself wasn't shit, the situation of crazy people around it made\nit shit and without them, i think it'd be great\n\n## concluding\n\ni cant stress enough how much i miss germany and how nostalgic i am for it even if it wasn't much experience\nin it, i still think it's much better than lithuania, in all of those years i've been in lithuania, i would\noverthrow it all by my little spent time in germany with alcoholic, abusive and borderline psychopathic parents\n\ni wish i could go back to it, and in the future i might lol\n\nari\n\n2023/12/13",

      "description": "me talking about the time i watched bluey with a friend, expressing my opinions on it and showing that bluey is a great show with a universally great experience",
      "content": "bluey is an australian childrens series, and as most childrens series it targets mostly younger audience,\nalthough bluey somehow manages to transcend the age barrier and is entertaining for both younger and older\nage grps, a lot of the show is also very cute and nice, its very comforting to watch\n\na friend of mine watched the show before me, then he suggested to watch the show together, and i agreed,\nat the time both of us were on discord so we used tht to watch it, first day of watching we ended up in a\n10 hour voice chat and the funny part is tht we didnt even finish s1 because of how much we were pausing it\nand commenting on it and stuff, for us to watch one episode took like 20 rather than 7 mins, well ofc w\nan error margin, but it took way longer than just watching it\n\ni remember one day us watching bluey, or well, planing on watching it and it ended up w hair dye and\nmessing around til midnight instead of watching bluey lmfao, it was funny how off-track it went, although\nwe did squeeze some bluey in there\n\nover the time we watched the show, probably a period of a couple of weeks to a month, idrr, but it was nice, every\nseason we talked abt the seasons and opinions and i think my fav season is probably s2, thts where most stuff\nhappens and its just nice\n\nepisodes such as 'magic xylophone', 'rug island', 'daddy robot' and 'dance mode' ( i believe thts the episode w the\nyes / no toy ) stood out to me as the cutest episodes, the friend i watched bluey w has a whole list of episodes\nhe really liked and iirc rug island is one of his favs and i cant help but to agree w his opinion, very valid\ntake, *gifts u a brown marker wrapped in a leaf*\n\ni think bluey is also a great show for adults, some episodes explore deeper themes like miscarriage, like in the\nepisode 'the show' iirc, the exploding balloon is a metaphor for a miscarriage, which was confirmed even by the\ncreator of bluey, theres a bunch of theories and clues scattered all across the series, the episode of 'sleepytime'\nis also extremely notable, its soundtrack is great, the episode starts with an already pretty cute moment of\nchilli ( bingos and blueys mother ) saying 'i will always be here whenever u need me' to bingo, in response to\nto bingo saying 'i want to have a big girl sleep today and wake up in my own bed', i think the whole episode is\na metaphor for maturity, character growth and responsibilities which come with growing older, then the episode\nshifts to a dreamland where bingo is transported into space, the episode shows a lot of elements of family and\nofc goofy moments relating to them, for example when bingo and bluey, being in the same dreamland, are tormenting\nbandit, their father, thinking theyre walking on a planet, at the near end of bingos dream we get another metafor for\nmaturity and growth when she loses her toy in saturns rings, showing how shes letting go of her childhood and\nproceeding to grow into a 'big girl', she shows sadness at first, then acceptance, followed by happiness, then shes\ntransported near the sun, which is a representation of her mother, and bingo says --\n'i have to go now, i am a big girl now' which is so wholesome, the whole episode is great and it shows how both\nbingo and bluey are growing, they show the importance of growth and independence with age, now now theyre\ngrowing into 'big girls', if ur unsure abt watching bluey, id suggest watching sleepytime and deciding\nfor urself\n\npretty much every episode is a game of sort and it always managed to delve into deeper themes under the surface\nof a simple childrens game, they explode themes like empathy and family, sentiments very important to talk abt,\nesp when ur growing up as a kid\n\neach episode is like a lesson of sort teaching you abt life with cute moments, quality animation, acting and sound,\nbluey might not seem that interesting at first, but it grows on you very fast once u begin watching it, watching\nsuch show u find urself laughing, wondering or even holding back tears, if not shedding a couple\n\ntheres a lot i liked abt bluey -- storyline, sound track, animation quality, emotional voice acting ( keep in mind, done by kids ! ),\neven though its targeted at pre-schoolers, i found it very entertaining and honestly would watch it again if i had the time\nto do so, its a great show, and i hope the most recent leaks are correct and we will get a 20 minute special\n\nbluey signifies tht kids shows are no longer purely for the realm for kids,, a great show is universal in its appeal\nand bluey is a great example which reflects that,, so now after all above, id suggest hop on the train and watch bluey\nto see what it has to offer\n\n~~dont get traumatized by the intro~~\n\ncya, hope u try out bluey\n\nari",

      "description": "exploring the standards of linux, gnu, posix, bsd and alternatives, expressing my opinions on a bunch of shit, showing some distributions and talking about linux in general, its all based off my opinion and personal exp so take stuff with a grain of salt, it does have a bit of standard, distro and code basing kinda lol, just me expressing my concerns abt it and stuff, opinions, anyway enjoy, cheers :3",
      "content": "hi\n\ni wanna nerd abt linux if u want read if u dont then dont ty, easy simple, anyway,\nill literally b covering linux from a to z so like if u knnow linux alrd this probs wont b\ninteresting and u probs have ur opinions on gnu and whatnot, esp the start when im explaining\nbasics, this is all opinions and personal exp so like dont take anything i say to heart danke\n\nfirst topic lets get the basics -- linux,, linux isnt an operating system on its own,\nlinux is actually an open source kernel -- a collection of apis, drivers, standards and other stuff\nallowing to interface with the hardware via code, it handles anything hardware related and\nis basically the 2 nd lowest thing on ur computer -- first one being efi firmware, which handles\nhardware initialization, loading of bootloaders and general base settings -- like the\nspark plug of the computer\n\nbut u cant rlly use a kernel on its own as is, this is where gnu+linux comes in, first to explain what\ngnu even is :\n\ngnu is a non-profit organization founded by richard stallman in 1985 which aims to promote and develop\nfree and open source software ( foss ), it advocates for users' rights to study, run, modify, distribute\nand share pieces of software ( their code ), gnu has made a huge impact on the open source community by\ncreating open source license called [gpl](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), a foundation named [fsf](https://fsf.org) and many popular open source projects,\na famous example being gnu bash -- an extremely popular shell used in many linux distributions\n\nalthough gnu has their issues with for example code quality, from personal exp gnu standards, code\ncleanliness, optimization and structure tend to b all over the place, well the code quality does vary,\nbut still, overall from what ive seen -- gnu code sucks, ill give it to them that the finished product\nis an easily usable utility with a good high level user interface, but like the code behind the scenes\nis horrid lol\n\nmy concern is that with such code less and less people will want to contribute and as gnu is extremely\nimportant to the open src community its very scary to see it be like this lol, i tried to contribute to\ngnu bash, boy when i saw that styling, structure and shit i ran away far far screaming for my dear life lol,\ni mean its not the worst gnu code ive seen but goddamn\n\ngnu also tends to fuck the standards lol, it doesnt stick to the core of posix, it adds its own things and\nthat not only enforces users to write bad code but also can make software slower, like ill give an example -- bash,\nusers tend to use bash over posix sh and bash scripts arent posix meaning it just sucks overall, bash also\ntends to b slower than just pure posix as it has more features and weirder standards, it can all b done in a\nposix script _basically_ just as easy, there are some caveats, but generally stick to posix sh lol, bash\nmakes u use their standards and i at least see standards as very important things, for example posix as per compared\nto not as solid or wide-spread gnu standards\n\nbut not all hope is lost with gnu+linux, a lot of distributions tend to strip out a lot of control out of gnu,\ngnu can handle many things including :\n\n- [userland utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)\n- [compiling code](https://gcc.gnu.org/)\n- [efi firmware](https://wiki.osdev.org/GNU-EFI)\n- [code debugging](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)\n- [booting process](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)\n- [system initialization](https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/)\n- [package manager](https://guix.gnu.org/)\n- [... and much much more](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html)\n\nmany distributions tend to use a couple of components of it, but at the end of the day its mainly users' choices,\ninstead of gnu coreutils u can use [busybox](https://www.busybox.net/)\ninstead of gnu gcc u can use [llvm clang](https://clang.llvm.org/),\ninstead of gnu-efi firmware u can use [tianocore](https://www.tianocore.org/),\ninstead of gdb u can use [lldb](https://lldb.llvm.org/),\ninstead of gnu grub u can use [systemd-boot](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/),\ninstead of shepherd u can use [openrc](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc),\ninstead of gnu guix u can use [portage utilities](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage)\nand so on, theres alternatives to everything gnu and the alternatives that ive mentioned\nhave alternatives -- its linux, the choice is urs\n\ntl;dr my main criticisms for gnu are code quality, performance and their standards, which can not only b\nless weird but can also b solid, simpler and generally id say most people would say better -- try posix :3\n\nbut thats where bsd comes in, during [the unix wars](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Unix_wars?lang=en)\nbsd and linux were rival competitors, at the end linux won, but bsd is still a great choice today\nif ur looking for simplicity, solid standardization, great licensing, freedom, choice, re-usability,\nrecreate-ability and general cleanliness, bsd is very so-to-say correct and does not go off the track\never, although as it lost the unix wars its much less popular and has less support for drivers ( hw support ),\ncommunity support might suck, breaking changes might still happen and bugs might b more common as maintaining\na project almost the size of linux with a community significantly is much harder, meaning also harder to\ncatch bugs and stuff, although because of bsd standards its much easier to fix and its probably not as bad\nif theres a bug in bsd if theres one in linux -- the bsd standards separate stuff more so if one part is going\nto fail theres 10 to back it up\n\ni personally prefer bsd standards, but i like linux, but thats where minimalist linux distros come in, heres\na few examples :\n\n- [crux](http://crux.nu/)\n- [gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)\n\nthese distributions are source-based meaning u can change p much anything,\nalthough in this case gentoo would b a worse choice than crux\n\nand another good example would b\n\n- [alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)\n\nit limits gnu stuff enough while still being a binary-ship distro, like using busybox for coreutils and\n[musl](https://musl.libc.org/)\ninstead of [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)\n\n[void linux](https://voidlinux.org/) isnt the worst either tho, but id say a worse alternative compared to alpine\n\ngenerally id say gnu+linux is def important, but there should b a balance, and seeing how gnu treats their\nstandards, code quality and stuff id say minimize gnu\n\nbut yeah, enough abt gnu and stuff, even though its a huge part of linux, i wanna talk abt some linux distributions\nas ive mentioned before\n\nthe sheer amt of linux distributions is honestly beautiful, this just shows how much choice linux users have,\nhow versitile linux is and how generally amazing linux is, theres distros focused on perfromance and size ( alpine linux,\nvoid linux ), distros focused on user friendlyness ( [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [debian linux](https://debian.org/), [linux mint](https://linuxmint.com/) ),\ndistros focused on user freedom ( gentoo, crux ), distros made for phones ( [android](https://www.android.com/), [postmarketos](https://postmarketos.org/) ),\ndistros made for servers ( debian, [rocky linux](https://rockylinux.org/) )\nand so on, its very cool\n\nalthough this can lead to a lot of bullshit, for example a user-oriented linux distribution\n[garuda linux](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Garuda_Linux?lang=en),\nin my honest opinion -- it was one of the worst ideas known in the linux history, i mean its my\nopinion, but i truely do believe in what im saying -- its extremly huge, its extremely bloated,\nits horribly stupid and generally its a horrid distro, it takes more resources to run garuda normally\nthan it takes to run windows, like how do u manage to fuck linux up this bad lol, i never liked that\ndistro and never will, im sry xD\n\ni feel stupid currently, i forgot what i rlly wanted to even say abt linux distros, but anyway yh,\nthats it ig xD, this is\n\nbut theres some other stuff like corporate involvement, code size and community stupidity sometimes,\nbut oh well, like linux could not survive without corporate involvement so yeah, code size is huge, 27 mil\nlines of code probs even more now, and thats excluding stuff like coreutils, and stupid community decisions\nlike introducing rust into the kernel, but ig if i use it i gotta live with it lol\n\nlinux can sure b amazing, but some stuff def annoys me abt it, anyway, i def advocate for bsd more than gnu+linux,\nor at least non-gnu linux, idk, its all opinions and preferences, dont take any this to heart\nim just saying xD\n\nanyway, thanks for listening to my 124ing and i shall no go back to not touching grass or something,\nidk, cya next time

      "content": "_( probably works with other redmis too, but ull have to change some shit with firmware and whatnot )_\n\ni recently rooted my phone and installed lineageos so making this guide i guess\n( huge credits to ducky, a person on the linux gang discord server, who has helped me a lot through all of this )\n\n**warning** this will void ur warranty and this worked for me, i cannot guarantee anything for ur device, make sure both magisk and lineageos support ur device\n\n- lineageos supported devices : <https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/>\n- magisk supported devices : theres no such list, but if lineageos supports it ur probably good, although i would recommend asking ai, looking stuff up and / or consulting others for guidance\n\nrequirements :\n\n- at least 1 computer\n- windows ( **required** for unlocking the bootloader )\n- linux ( for everything else, although can b done on windows too, just easier on linux lol and as im a linux user this has more resources on that )\n- a xiaomi redmi 8 phone which is [supported by lineageos](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/) ( this guide might work with other redmis, but u will have to make changes in firmware and stuff u download )\n\n( u might want to dualboot or spin up a vm if u have access to a singular computer )\n\n**by reading further u take full responsibility for anything that might happen to ur device and want to see the tutorial**\n\n## abstract\n\nthis tutorial walks through the process of enabling developer options on a redmi 8 device,\nunlocking the bootloader using the official mi unlock tool, then\nthrough the process of installing lineageos through recovery,\npatching the boot image using magisk and installing it so u can have a rooted lineageos system, i also\ncover the process of recovery in case of a failed installation\n\nthis guide is for redmi 8 mainly, although if ur using it as a resource for other redmis\nmake sure to change out redmi 8 specific parts like partition flashing, roms, etc\n\n## part one -- developer options\n\nfirst u will have to enable developer options before doing anything, u might\nhave to repeat this step multiple times during the process of this tutorial\n\n- to to settings\n- go to miui version\n- spam click til it says 'u are now a developer'\n\nnow :\n\n- go to settings home\n- go to additional settings\n- go to developer options\n- enable OEM unlocking\n- enable usb debugging\n\n## part two -- host machine setup\n\ni personally used linux for most of this process, but i did have to use windows on my stepfathers laptop\nfor unlocking the bootloader ( mentioned below ), stuff u will need is simple\n\n- `adb`\n- `fastboot`\n\nthese tools are usually available as `android-tools` in linux, for example\n[the arch linux android-tools package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/android-tools/)\non windows u will probably also require a few usb drivers, although i dont rlly have a clue,\non my stepfathers windows 10 pc i had to install\n\n- the drivers from the mi unlock tool ( mentioned below ) by pressing 'install driver' button\n- https://www.xiaomidriversdownload.com/xiaomi-usb-drivers-official/\n\nthen had to reboot the laptop\n\nbut at this step, if ur on windows, ull have to figure out what drivers u need and how to install\n`fastboot` and `adb`, everything else should work for both linux and windows\n\n## part three -- bootloader unlocking prep\n\n### exploit for mediatek devices\n\n( edit @ 2023/09/07 )\n\nif u have a mediatek device, u can try out <https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient#unlock-bootloader>,\nthis method was tested ( discovered ? ) by once again ducky ( who helped me do all of this android stuff\nin the first place ), and it works, b aware of <https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient#unsupported-chipsets>\ntho\n\nusing this method has these advantages, top one being the most important :\n\n- **the 7-day unlock time is bypassed**\n- no need to remember ur mi acc password as ur not prompted with it\n- u can re-lock the device and keep ur warranty so they cant tell that it was ever flashed or unlocked\n- no need for a sim card, mobile data or a mi account\n\nand as per disadvantages, ill just leave this quote by ducky himself :\n\n> actually, if you're on a mediatek device, absolutely not, in fact, it's\n> objectively better AND easier than the official method\n>\n> just hold two buttons, plug the cable in, run a command, run another one\n> to reset the device, unpluig the cable, profit\n>\n> correction: two commands\n>\n> you still need to wipe data\n>\n> that's one command\n>\n> I was being extra safe and I backed up the seccfg partition\n>\n> but not needed\n\n### official method\n\nxiaomi devices come with a locked bootloader, meaning u have to unlock them,\nin our case we will use the official [mi unlock tool which u can download here](https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html)\nwhich is only available on windows, i have tried everything else, including ( but not limited to ) fucking around\nwith adb and the unofficial mi unlock tool, but nothing worked, so its best u just get\na laptop with windows or maybe a vm with usb passthrough, maybe find some better solution that works\non linux ( or ur setup ), but idk\n\nafter downloading the tool, run it and log into ur account using ur password and phone number\n( password will be required later so make sure to note it or something, make sure to not make it very\ncomplex because the password will be required to type by hand later ), if u dont have one, make sure\nto make one\n\nthen connect ur phone to ur pc using a usb connection and make sure to allow usb debugging when\nit prompts u to enable it\n\nthen open settings -> additional settings -> developer options and\npress on 'mi unlock status' and then :\n\n- make sure u have a sim card inserted ( u have to keep it inserted always for it to unlock )\n- turn off wifi and enable mobile data\n- press add account and device\n\npress agree and follow the instructions\n\nthen u will have to wait a painful long while, at least a week if not longer,\nxiaomi **_really_** hates users who want to gain control of their device, it might be anywhere\nfrom a week to months, nobody knows, but all u have to do at this stage is\n\n- not log out of the mi unlock tool ( yes u can close it, but not log out, logging out resets everything )\n- wait\n- check on it semi-weekly ( like every 1.5-2 weeks or so )\n\n### how do u know that u are legible for unlocking ?\n\nwell, just repeat the process of running the tool, connecting and whatnot\nand one day u will see that the 'unlock' button will b available\n\n## part four -- bootloader unlocking\n\nnow, as u can unlock the bootloader, dont jump straight into it, make sure :\n\n- u know ur mi account password and it isnt so complex u cant type it by hand\n- u have all ur data backed up ( this step will erase all data )\n- u dont care about the warranty ( this step will void it )\n\nthen, if ur device is ready and all set, press 'unlock', this step shouldnt take long, it should\ngo by pretty quickly and then ull b booted into a stock rom basically\n\nwhen u boot into it, u will b prompted for ur mi account password to unlock ur phone,\nenter it and thats it, after this step u will have to repeat the enabling developer options\nstep again\n\n## part five -- lineageos installation\n\n**this part might fail, if it does, just see <#:recovery>**\n\nnow, as ur phone is fully unlocked and set up for lineageos, its time to flash it, for redmi 7a, 8, 8a and 8a dual\nthe rom download page is <https://download.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/builds> so grab the latest build from there\nand extract it, also make sure to download `super_empty.img` from the builds page as its not included in the build zip\n\nnow, connect ur phone again with usb debugging enabled and fastboot it using this command\n( on windows ull probably have to use cmd.exe or powershell or something, not a clue ) :\n\n    adb reboot bootloader\n\nextract ur build ( make sure u still have the zip of the build saved, but do extract it ), `cd` into the\ndirectory, make sure u have the `super_empty.img`, then flash the needed partitions for installation through recovery :\n\n    fastboot flash dtbo dtbo.img\n    fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img\n    fastboot wipe-super super_empty.img\n    fastboot flash recovery recovery.img\n    fastboot boot recovery.img\n\nif the `wipe-super` command is not found, make sure ur adb is up to date\n\nthese commands vary based on what firmware u have, always make sure to consult the lineageos wiki,\nfor example <https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/install/variant2>\n\nthen using volume and power keys go to factory reset -> format data / factory reset and format\neverything, this will erase _everything_\n\nafter that go back to the home menu of the recovery, press 'apply update' and select 'apply from adb', then\nuse this command to fully install lineageos :\n\n    adb sideload lineage-<...>.zip\n\nthe zip is the one u downloaded from the builds page\n\nif something fails, try to flash the stock rom first, which is covered in <#:recovery>,\nafter it is all done, proceed to boot into lineageos\n\n## part six -- magisk installation ( rooting )\n\n**this part might fail, if it does, just see <#:recovery>**\n\nin the extracted lineageos zip there is a `boot.img` file, save it on ur phone using `adb push boot.img /path/on/to/phones/storage` or anything else\nu prefer and install the [latest magisk app from their releases by downloading the apk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)\nthen open the magisk app, press install, check both 'patch vbmeta in boot image' and 'recovery mode'\ncheckboxes, press next, press select 'select and patch a file' or something, select the `boot.img`\nand patch it, after its done patching, transfer it back to ur computer using preferred method, i prefer\n`adb pull /path/on/to/phones/storage/magisk_patched-<...>.img .` personally\n\nnow fastboot ur phone again, making sure its still connected, then boot the patched image :\n\n    fastboot boot magisk_patched-<...>.img\n\nthis boot into rooted lineageos, when it boots, go into the magisk app, press 'install' and select 'direct install',\nwhen it asks for superuser access, allow it, then itll install\n\nafter it installs, u are now free to reboot into ur rooted lineageos system\n\n## part seven -- verifying root\n\nnow, after u boot into ur rooted system, verify it, go into magisk and see the 'superuser' tab, if its grayed out,\nur phone isnt rooted, if u can access it, then it is rooted, even then, not counting that in, in the 'install section'\nit should show that u have magisk installed and should show u the version of magisk installed\n\nif it didnt root, maybe proceed to repeat the rooting step or seek community support\n\nand if it did, ur done, enjoy ur new rooted lineageos system :)\n\n## recovery\n\nif lineageos is working, but u borked ur boot image, just fastboot and run this :\n\n    fastboot flash boot boot.img\n\nwhere `boot.img` is ur original boot image ( u can get it in the lineageos build zip ), then just reboot\n\nelse, if something failed and u only have fastboot access ( meaning u havent bricked ur phone ) its easily fixable :\n\n- download default fastbot rom, for redmi 8 its <https://miuirom.org/phones/redmi-8#Global> ( older firmware -> fastboot ( currently 4.05 GB tgz file ) )\n- extract the tgz using `tar xvf <filename>.tgz`\n- `cd` into the directory\n- make sure ur phone is connected through usb\n- run `bash flash_all.sh`\n- boot into stock rom\n\nand well, if ur phone is in a state where it wont even boot into fastboot, i have nothing to say, best of luck\ntrying to fix it :), a person told me <https://new.c.mi.com/global/post/460894> might b helpful in such state",

      "content": "today i was talking to people about trans stuff as i am trans myself, it all\nstarted by me talking to one of my friends about it bc she wanted to so yh, we did,\nand i thought it might be interesting to share\n\nso, the topics will include :\n\n- suicide\n- gender dysphoria\n- other social issues\n- transitioning\n- medicine\n- discrimination\n- harsh reality of being trans\n\nkeep in mind, i am no professional or anything, ill just be talking from my personal\nexp, other trans ppl i met exp and publically available statistics, and obv not talking\nfor every trans person\n\nso, i feel like its an undeniable fact that being trans isnt just roses, tulips, cakes\nwith cherries on top and strawberry scented perfume, its a constant fight for your rights,\nquestioning, discrimination, genocide and suicide\n\ntrans people are very suicidal, and do u rlly think its a coincidence,\n[the statistics speak for themselves](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/)\nand its only proven by the fact that terms like\n[transgender suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_genocide)\nexist, not only that, theres many other publically available statistics that just\nprove my fucking point, no matter how much i fucking say it, like\n[worse healthcare and more addiction, mental illness, etc ( w : statistic from 2015 but i doubt much has changed )](https://www.amsa.org/action-committee/gender-and-sexuality/transgender-health/)\ni could go on and on about statistics, but these are just few things out of like a billion\nthings why being trans sucks, which also should be enough proof for transphobes that being\ntrans is in fact, not a choice\n\ncontinuing the saga, being trans alone is literally close to fucking impossible,\nbeing individualistic is hard bc of discrimination, how the world treats you and so on,\nsuicide rates are high as mentioned, meaning having someone is def needed, getting\nproper trans care is hard, waitlists are long ( 1-3 yrs from what ive searched )\neven then its not guaranteed to be good healthcare, people wait for yrs to get it\nand people die in the process due to usually, well, mentioned suicide, even if u\nmanage to wait it out, ull have to do it again, and again, and again, it never stops,\nthe system is built to kill and torment trans people\n\ni also feel like a 'diagnosis' for gender dysphoria is complete and utter bullshit, i mean\nwhy do i have to prove if im 'trans enough' to transition, do cis people have to prove theyre\n'cis enough' to get hormones, for example cis men getting TRT, they can just go to their\ngeneral practitioner and get it, but oh if a trans person needs it they have to go through\nmultiple psychologists and psychiatrists, get on multiple large wait time waitlists, try to\nget a prescription, lie, face many troubles just to do the same thing cis people can get done\nin a couple of days lol, it feels like this is just an extra step and an excuse for trans\ngenocide, this also enforces an idea of 'transgender = mental illness' bc you have to\nget a diagnosis to be 'medically' trans\n\nin the mean time we can only continue fighting, expressing ourselves, protesting,\ntalk to people, educate them, share\nour experiences, call out, poke fun and just show how ridiculous this transphobia rooted system\nis, how fucked up and deranged it is, hopefully more people understand it and accept it instead\nof being trans seen as a shameful thing people should be killed for, we, as trans people,\nhave to work as a community if we want greater good for us ( current generation of trans\npeople ) and future generations of trans people and thankfully we realised this way before\nand are working towards, so if youre trans or an ally, dont be quiet, educate, support,\ndo something about it,\ndont stick to an individualistic mindset of 'what will this do *to me, and only me specifically*',\nthink about what will it achieve for the whole community rather than you specifically\n\nand for future generations of transgender people, you are 'trans enough' even if that exists\n\nand as per my personal exp, its not good either, i mean its gotten better over the yrs and\nlithuania is moving forward, but its very far from perfect and its still a very anti-lgbt\ncountry which has a lot of room to improve, not even related to lgbt stuff, in general, lithuania\nis piss, online i still get quite a bit of transphobia and many people like to use the fact\nthat im trans to make me look bad, which is extremely stupid, but oh well, what can u\nexpect from transphobes right lmao,,\n\nanyway, the final message id like to leave before going is :  let go of your self-centered mindset\nand work towards the greater good of the entire transgender community, including yourself,\ndont remain in the shadows of ignorance, instead, raise your voice and fight for equal rights until\nwe are all treated as human beings once again\n",

      "content": "right so ... schr\u00f6dingers crush\n\nlet me explain what a schr\u00f6dingers crush even is, basically i just made this thing up, based\noff [schr\u00f6dingers cat](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat?lang=en), lets say ur in the same\nsituation as me right now, u hate to love and love to hate, ur crush is basically ( although figuratively )\ndead, which is what i will talk about today\n\ni think ( actually i probably know ) that i have a schr\u00f6dingers crush, i wont mention him by name, but lets\ncall him idk jack if itll be relevant\n\nanyway, ive been crushing on him since around 8 th grade, now im soon-to-be 10 th grader and im starting to have\nmore of a hate for him than love, ive spent quite a chunk of time on him, worrying abt him, thinking abt him,\ngenerally crushing on him, its sad but it happens, oh well, most ppl just get over it, although if u\nspend enough time on a person and like them a lot like me, u develop a **schr\u00f6dingers crush**,\nwhich is quite painful, i hate to love him is what im trying to say lol, ive had my fair share of rose\ntinted glasses by now and am seeing him now, like im not in anything serious with him but hes def more to\nme than just 'some rando idc abt'\n\nanyway, few reasons :\n\ni dont like the way hes perfect, like hes crazy perfect, all in looks, social life and skills, hes very\nattractive, as proven by literally everyone finding him attractive, hes opposite of what ud call *bitchless*,\nhis proportions are good, hands a nice, hes tall and i find his voice somewhat pleasing but sometimes i just\ncant listen to it lol hes very social, friendly and nice and hes VERY skillful, hes like cracked at everything, hes wikipidia\nsquared, he knows so much its just damn, ppl only having specific knowledge at something like me with it can beat him\nat one specific subject, hes so perfect its hard to see his flaws, which is very annoying,\ndue to this everyone likes him, treats him as flawless and like some sort of monarch i feel like lol\n\n... due to that, hes also very overpowering, lets take school as an example, right until he wasnt my classmate,\ni.e. this yr, to me he looked like the perfect, smart, cute guy, although this yr were classmates and i uh, thats\nno, bad, teachers love him and give him priority, even then, jack just talks, but if he doesnt everyone just\nexpects jack to say smt at this point, only time its rlly not that bad to talk to him is when hes not in school,\nits not as overpowering and u just get less scared and actually have a way in something rather than being\nshut down by some 124 ( \ud83e\udd13 nerding \ud83e\udd13 nerd \ud83e\udd13 idc abt ur paragraphs \ud83e\udd13 shut up \ud83e\udd13 talking to a wall )\nnerd lol, i mean i feel bad for saying this but still, its annoying as a fellow classmate of his that hes like this,\nwhat makes it worse is that hes my crush\n\nonce, around the start of the yr iirc, he also pulled a 'dont let them know ur last move' move, basically we\nhad to present our favourite person, i presented my best friend iirc or grandma idr, others presented their\nfamily and stuff, u will not guess what this smart ass of a man presented ... andrew tate, omg, andrew tate, that\nsmooth ass egg looking mf whos a proven sex trafficker, misogynist and an abuser, thats HIS FAVOURITE PERSON,\nliterally nobody expected that from him, the class went so silent when he presented him ... its just woah, anyway,\nthats my first huge red flag for him, but oh well right ? if he doesnt act on it or anything its fine ? right ????\n\ni uh, yeah, uh, he acts on it \ud83d\udc4d obv not as bad ( actually idk, idk what he does in his free time lmao )\nas andrew tate ( bc that would be illegal ), but def makes weird comments publically, for example in politics class\nwe had like a lesson abt womens rights, he literally laughed at it, and not like its the only time, he did it\nmultiple times, although i cant fully recall it, i def remember politics class, two incidents, 2 nd was abt abortion\nrights where he once again laughed at it\n\nalso one more weird thing, i cant recall if it was before the womens rights incident or after, but basically, in english\nclass, him together with his friends were making fun of me being lgbt lol, like im fairly 'lgbt looking' irl and\nclass knows i think lol, although i never said it directly, anyway, as ive mentioned it was english class at the time\nand when they made fun of me english teacher got so man, like yeah, i get it, but omg i literally almost started\nshaking, i got red and embarrassed, confused even, it was such a painful situation, like yes, im grateful for it,\nbut oh god, i even asked 'what happened huh what huh' and she just shut me lol, i feel sorry for them,, but i mean,,,,,,\ni,, i dont think i do ? do i ? i mean idk tbh, eh, so this just adds to his pile of bullshit\n\nanyway, i think this is enough to prove he isnt flawless like i thought and p much everyone to this day thinks, hes\nopposite of that and thats why i hate to like him, hes not what he presents as, hes fucking horrible, i mean,\nhes not horrible, but hes not good, omg, i feel like im giving him such a large chance to look good but hes fucking\nit over, its so annoying, its like the rose tinted glasses are superglued on me, im fucking over this so much,\ni hate it, its painfully hard to get over my feelings for him even though I WISH i could, i hate it, its bad and\new, i wish i just didnt need to see him lol, i wish i didnt feel anything for him and i was free to see him as just\n'some weird nerd rando i dislike', wish i could see him anything but perfect, thankfully my rose tinted glasses\nare falling off at a rapid rate and i hope it stays this way lol\n\nanyway, hope u never have to go though a schr\u00f6dingers crush, get out of this delusion as quick as u can, get out of\nthe rose tinted glasses stage as far as u can, i stayed in my delusion and now im here, crushes dont go anywhere\nusually anyway, so fuck it lol, drop it while u can\n",

      "content": "hi\n\nim fucking exhausted from today, i mean not that it was physical or anything, its\nliteral saturday and ive been just too depressed to get out of bed, although a thing made\nit much worse and almost pushed me into a panic attack\n\nbasically a friend of mine has been threatening to contact a person i like a lot recently,\nlike sure, thats fine, idc, but she always makes it seem so creepy, like she wants to make me\nlook like a stalker, but especially today, she wrote a love letter and threatened me to send it,\ni begged that she wouldnt and yeah, then she actually sent it and said it had my name on it\nand i believed it as the original one had my name in it and all, she already threatened me to do it,\nshe threatened other times to contact him for me ( like one time, which also sounded so creepy\nwas when she wanted to *'scare'* him into talking to me, like imagine how creepy that would be ) ...\ni went full panic mode, first depression came but then my anxiety and anger took over, i told her\nto go fuck herself ( including the rest of the people who saw this happen ) and went away to try to cope,\nmusic never helps so i scrapped that, then i went to hit my head, that just made me nauseous, then\ni looked for more coping mechanisms but i was too tense to be able to look at everything at detail,\ni was pulling my hair to release some tension, but yeah, guess what she did next, she fucking told me\nshe didnt do it and put her name instead, like omfg, did she just want to play with my feelings\nor something, play with me like a toy, im very sensitive and i told everyone that multiple times,\nshe knows how i reacted to other of her attempts, etc. i felt horrible and even more anger took me\nover but at that point ( even though it was only like 10 mins ) i was too tired to scream, then\nmore depression and remorse came over me so i apologized\n\n( for context i always magically feel like shit in history lessons ) this friday ( aka yesterday )\ni had history, like always i felt a bit poo but its fine, nothing unusual, the lesson went as usual,\nthe subject we went over went ok, next lesson ( i had 2 histories in a row ) we had to do some tasks,\nsure, i started doing them, i did almost all of them but he ( being my history teacher ) kept talking\nabout some map, like i knew what map but he gave us some task, i was confused, i asked him what the task\nit, instead of telling me like a normal person, he begun shouting, he took a classmates work and shoved\nit in my face, shouting how 'i was supposed to do this' like wtf am i supposed to get out of a\ncoloured map, then he told me, we were meat to colour parts of the map ... THAT WERE ALREADY FUCKING\nCOLOURED OMFG, after that, when i was hurrying to do it as i was embarrassed and hurt already he told\nmy friend, which was sitting next to me, to give me her work or smt, at this point i was feeling horrible,\nbut oh well, i refused and i told him to stop being like this, 'its fine, i didnt ask for it, stop, please\nstop' trying to make his ass stop bc i felt tears coming in, he did stop, good, after that i asked her\nfor her work so i could do it quicker anyway as i felt shit enough already from history and now the teacher\nwith added embarrassment, the lesson ended, i walked out of the school feeling like garbage, its fine\nthough\n\nthen, on thursday, we had religion class, the whole day they were taking stuff from a person, shes\nkinda quarter friend, but that day it pissed me off, she kept talking and talking abt it, we also\ntalked more than usual that day, etc. and it annoyed me, so basically, in religion class the friend\ndidnt have her phone, i had a chance to take the phone from the person who stole it ( bc omg i found\nit so fucking annoying ) so i took the chance, i walked up and tried to take her phone from him ( the\nperson who stole it ), i failed but oh well, went back to my seat, after that the most annoying motherfucker\nout there, i wont say his name but lets call him p ( so him, p, etc. dont mix ), p decided to make a comment\nhow i need a psychiatrist and even 'offering' to take me there, i just replied that i already have one\n( as i do ), i said 'yeah ? to g, shes a fucking bitch' i said ( assume g is my psychiatrist ),\nthen there, as a classmate who has the same name as g said 'im not ur psychiatrist' and i said something\nalong the lines of 'cool, shes kinda a bitch, yalls personality kinda resembles', like i dont like g ( the classmate )\noverall, but i can bare her, she pissed me off so i just said how it is, anyway, that was a fucking\nmistake and in conclusion to this day, i need to mind my own business and stop getting annoyed when the\nsame fucking person talks about the same thing over and over again lol, i have a bad habit of taking action\ninto my own hands if it bothers me, anyway\n\non tuesday and wednesday as far as i remember nothing much happened and same for monday as once again i just\nspent my day in bed, depressed, as i didnt have school\n\nmoving a week forward, on wednesday, omg, once again, the music teacher being an annoying bitch,\nshe has a habit of being entitled and being sure she did something when for a fact she didnt, like\none time she said she definitely told us to learn parts of mass ( as in christian mass ) as a music\ngenre, sanctus or whatnot, when she fucking didnt, she didnt, nobody knew that and the max grade was 9\nlmao ( we use 1-10 here ), now this time, once again during a test, we only had listened to 10 songs\nbut she gave us a test from 20, although this time she was a bit more sane and gave us time to listen\nto the songs we need and told us that we can write next week, but she still insisted she told us and that\nwe listened to every song, when in fact we only had listened to 10 of them, oh well, next week we wrote it\nand it went ok, i got a 9, possibly bc i mistook song #11, but i dont know, well see next week\n\nnow, some misc things that happened and i dont remember when\n\n- some day school psychologist made a microsoft teams group ( as were forced to use that piece of shit )\n  with a few mentally unstable people in school, including me, in a month were having days where we have no school\n  but we do practice work and stuff, so she suggested for us, unstable people, to join, actually i might lol,\n  all other lessons sound like shit and i dont want to work that hard during those days, psychology will be like\n  self discovery and stuff, i found that funny how in a school of like 420 or smt people i was added there,\n- i finished reading 1984, i enjoyed it, i presented it and this week i gave my work to the teacher to\n  rate and stuff, well see how it turns out, hoping its fine\n- i havent done serious code in a while so thinking about developing something, maybe a package manager ( maybe\n  even some linux distro from scratch ), maybe a programming language or smt, i kinda want to work on something\n  bc i feel like im losing motivation lol and idk\n- i have *a lot* of tests coming up, like almost 2 weeks straight of tests lol, horrible, im terrified,\n  i had such thing before already, i did horribly, i got such bad grades from all of them because i was overwhelmed\n  by so many tests, this will probably be the same, lovely\n- i dropped my daily calorie intake, wont give any numbers, but my body isnt taking it well, i mean it was\n  small before, but its even smaller, am not able to maintain it that good, like i dont go over the limit\n  but i feel worse, like today i stood up and just fell to the ground like a bag of bones\n- overall, im losing my life more and more, i quit therapy and stuff ( ive talked about it before ),\n  so im just there losing my last hope lol, oh well, too bad\n\nanyway, hope this wasnt too painful to read, for fun me and my friends read some fanfics and omg theyre\nso badly written i cant, hope u dont have the same exp here, til next time\n",

      "content": "## warning : this post includes spoilers !!\n### ( if u want my work, im happy to share it, although its in lithuanian, email me : [ari.web.xyz@gmail.com](mailto:ari.web.xyz@gmail.com)  )\n\ni just finished reading 1984 as i needed to pick a book to read for school\nand i already wanted to read it so yeah, i found a lithuanian translation and\nit was honestly extremely good\n\nbasically of a summery of my work\n\n> Throughout their diary entries, the reader provides a comprehensive and engaging account\n> of their journey through \"1984\" by George Orwell. The reader discusses each chapter\n> or section of the book that they have read, summarizing the events and themes\n> covered and providing their own thoughts and insights.\n>\n> The reader notes the pervasive and extreme methods of control used by the Party,\n> including censorship, propaganda, and surveillance, which are designed to maintain complete\n> obedience and conformity among the population. The reader also describes how Winston's character\n> is subjected to torture, brainwashing, and degradation, leading to his ultimate subjugation and submission to the Party.\n>\n> The reader expresses their admiration for the book's writing style, which\n> they describe as engaging, well-crafted, and emotionally resonant. The reader notes\n> that some parts of the story are difficult to read due to their disturbing and emotionally\n> intense nature, but also acknowledges the book's ability to\n> provoke strong emotional reactions and convey important messages about power, control, and individual freedom.\n>\n> In addition, the reader provides an in-depth analysis of various themes and motifs in the book, such as the nature of truth,\n> the power of language and thought, and the dangers of authoritarianism. The reader also reflects on their\n> own experiences and emotions while reading the book, offering a personal and vulnerable perspective on the story.\n>\n> In the end, the reader gives the book a rating of 11/10 and highly recommends it to others. The reader's diary entries are a\n> thoughtful, nuanced, and comprehensive analysis of \"1984\" and its themes, while also conveying the emotional\n> impact of the story on the reader.\n\nbasically, i found book very interesting, the beginning and middle were very fun to read, but\nthe end was scary, basically, even though i didnt have much to say, i liked it, it showed how winston\nchanges over time and stuff, how winston gets so brainwashed into submission by the party into loving\nbig brother, how he falls into submission that 2 + 2 can be anything, how he and jualia betrayed\none another and what at first seemed fluffy love with a cliche storyline, it ended in a heartbreaking\nstop to their relationship and then the death of winston with his brainwashed and crushed personality\nafter a lot of torture and jailing\n\nits a very engaging story with an interesting storyline, ive only read one good ( but not as good )\nbook, white shroud ( baltoji drobul\u0117 ) by antanas \u0161k\u0117ma, both had a very nice story line and i really\nenjoyed reading them, both of them showed strong emotion which i really liked, characters faced trouble\nin life but somehow managed and overall they were good books\n\nwhile reading 1984 i made this blog post -- <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/corporate-marionettes/> and\n1984 was an inspiration for me even though i already used that term before ive read it, thats why\n1984 still stands to this day, in the age where companies get a monopoly on peoples data and algorithms\nso good to keep u on there its like the party shoving u into its ideologistic system, which many people\nare brainwashed, like winston at the end, to not resist and follow their trails without saying a word\n\none of the most striking parts for me is how much impact totalitarianism makes to a human mind, winston\nwas healthy and was correct, party should be overthrown and is not stable, it is an oppressive mess\nbuilt on hate and discrimination, but then they turned him into a weak bag of bones which was easily\nforced into submission and their ideology, they turned him into a toy without any will or identity\n\nto conclude, i think anyone interested in power, control, truth and individual freedom should read it, its\na lovely and interesting book and i think a lot of people would enjoy it\n\nhave a nice day, hopefully i peaked your interest a bit :)\n",

      "description": "basically a dupe of 'transgender' post without me even knowing lol",
      "content": "omfg at this point i have to say something, its pissing me off how much transphobia is affecting me and\nother trans people recently, as a trans person, MTF, i get quite a lot of hate just from being trans,\nwhether its online in trolling, bullying form or irl bullying, other forms discrimination and so on, i\nfucking hate how the world is currently, so let me talk about it\n\nfirst up, let me define what transphobia is, transphobia is defined as follows :\n\n> Transphobia is a type of discrimination or prejudice against transgender\n> or gender non-conforming individuals. It can take many forms, including verbal\n> or physical abuse, exclusion from social or professional opportunities, or denial\n> of basic human rights. Transphobia is based on a lack of understanding or acceptance\n> of gender identity that does not conform to traditional binary notions\n> of male and female. It can have serious negative effects on the mental health and\n> well-being of trans individuals, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide.\n\nbut i call it 'the feeling that makes me feel shit at every moment of my life and any\ncomments can set it off, although im too much of a pussy to say anything about it bc i am a useless\nanti-social idiot on top of that i get treated like dog shit except that at least gets picked up :)'\n\nthe current state of trans people as a group is bad, everything is going to shit and it seems like\neveryone is going after us for everything, ive met so many transphobes in the recent times and tbh\nim scared to say anything about it, like i want to, but i cant, my brain isnt letting me, im\nscared and i cant do anything about it, like tranphobes made me think that standing by my own points\nis bad and should not be done but instead you should suffer in silence and say nothing abt it,\nwhich is total fucking bullshit, i am so fucking done with all of this i cant, i want to be able to,\nbut its just fucking impossible, my brain has that engraved and i hate it, i feel like a trapped rat\nin their prison of bigotism and discrimination, at this point if a person finds out im trans and they\ncomment about it i feel the need to be sorry about my identity and say 'im sorry that im trans, you\nprobably think im gross and shit, sorry' or something along the lines of that, it feels like\nwe, as a group of people are being forced into some sort of modern hitler-esc ideology where the world\nis monogamous and anything else than that should be made extinct\n\nnone of this is pretty or good, i might say its 'fine' when youre being directly transphobic to my face\nbut its really not and behind your back im not happy with any of what uve said or done, i use laughing\n( even online ) to deflect tension, i hate it, why do yall feel like we have to fit into your fucking\nclosed off box of little one-braincell ideology, fuck this shit and fuck you for doing all the shit you\ndo to make our lives as painful as you can, your complaining about how its 'unnatural, gross, ungodly,\nbad, cringe, stupid, confusing' and etc. is so fucking annoying, we already are a very small group with\nvery little rights and on top of that yall overpower us with like 2387678296789326% of the population going\nafter us, like come fucking on, get a life and stop being a plain fucking asshole, im so sorry for using\nsuch stupid language but i am so fucking mad at so many people and theres nothing i can really do than\ncomplain about how shitty their behaviour is\n\none of the [situations](https://user.ari-web.xyz/#89) that triggered me to write this is mrbeast situation about the 'karl effect' or\nsome shit, god i see transphobes cling onto that so much on the internet now, its painful to even watch,\nits gross, this is nothing than pure homophobia and transphobia\n\nanother situation is me actually facing anti-lgbt stuff both irl and online today, wont get into\ndetail bc i dont want to\n\nand what do u know, [texas loves this shit too](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/25/texas-agriculture-department-dress-memo-sid-miller)\n'consistent to their biological gender' my ass, my brain hurts from the stupidity of transphobes,\ntheir hitler-like ideology, stupid fucking idiocy which keeps bothering me\n\nthis isnt just a US issue either, this is very relevant is every country and continent, for example, even in\neurope, which id consider fairly developed, this is a large issue, we still face issues with healthcare ( actually\nA LOT of issues ), employment, education, and housing, this is especially visible in like poland and hungary where\nits like built in lmao, lets not forget to mention my homeland of lithuania, being any type of lgbt anywhere\noutside capital city of vilnius is terrible, i face a lot of anti-lgbt comments, bullying ( to the point of physical\nharassment ) and so on, everywhere and anywhere i go, i even get spit on sometimes just bc i dont present\n\u2728 typically male \u2728, omfg, i hate this, but america, africa, australia, asia and so on also have the same issues,\nin america its right-wing individuals who are trying to shunt down transgender people all bc it doesnt fit into\ntheir conservative view of the world ( and so, they should be made extinct ), africa due to religious and cultural\nviews on gender and sexuality, australia is progressing but trans people still have quite a lot to deal with both\nsocially and access to services like healthcare and asia, once again about religious and cultural views\n\nnot that i find this funny, but its funny how close minded people are everywhere around the world, i mean yes, there\nare people who are truely open minded, but theres so many people calling themselves tolerant 'as long as i dont see them'\nor 'as long as its not my kids' or some shit, or freak out whenever a trans person comes out and they go attack\nthem just bc, actually in my psychology class we had a similar test, basically like 99% of the class called themselves\ntolerant, including myself, then we were questioned and questioned 'would you accept this person if they were a part of\n[some minority]' and other questions, they were related to race, culture, religion, sexuality, gender, etc. and guess\nhow many hands were left at the end out of 29 ... 2, fucking two, me and another classmate, omfg, i find this so fucking\ncringe and just terrible, how can you call yourself tolerant if you do this shit, my god\n\ni also find some of the reasons funny, like 'its religion' or some shit, like alright, believe in what you want, but\nhow does that give you the right to discriminate against and stuff other people ? how does that change the\nfact that youre transphobic and want people dead ? how does that change anything that youre doing, its still horrible\nand not acceptable, this applies to anything, ive heard people use the same excuse over and over and over again\nfor all sorts of topics, including racism, homophobia, transphobia, abilism and fatphobia, which none of those\nare okay\n\nanyway, concluding, transphobes fucking suck and everything about them is cringe, bad and theyre little pricks with no\nlife, i hate how many people like that exist in all shapes and sizes, in all countries, all identities, cultures, races,\ncontinents, unions and so on, but i guess ill keep pretending 'its fine, you can be transphobic, yeah i totally\ndont care, im sorry for being so gross and bad in your eyes, ill try my best to not be trans :))'\n\ntake care .\n",

      "content": "i unironically use 'corporate marionette' to describe people who are sheep\nto companies, usually in context of digital privacy, which is becoming a more and more\nconcerning issue and worst part, nor people in power nor general public isnt doing anything\nabt it, its genuinely sad to see how brainwashed people are and how much they dont give\na fuck about it, not understanding ( actually not even wanting to understand ) how big\nof an issue this is and how theyre basically marionettes for companies\n\nin this post 'corporate marionette' will be referring to the more specific digital\ncorporate marionette and not general corporate marionette, although there might be\nmentions of both types, the primary audience of this post are people who're ( if i say\nwhore, i dont mean whore, i mean who're ) interested in digital corporate marionettes\nand people who are willing to learn more about it and are stuck in the corporate marionette\necosystem :)\n\nbefore reading this, please keep in mind that i talk a lot about proprietary stuff, as that tends\nto be more evil than open source, but keep in mind open source companies can still be creepy and weird\n\nlets start off with the issue itself -- at a high level this is purely a digital privacy issue,\nbut under it, we have more issues, including addiction, bad education, other mental health problems\nand ignorance, sometimes even if youre aware its hard to make the switch without dropping\nhalf your life down the drain, todays society is focused on being a corporate marionette, once\nagain due to the same issues\n\nwe already broke the problem down, so lets address some of the issues one by one,\n\nfirst -- **addiction**, many people, probably including me ( although im unsure ), are addicted\nto technology, they get hooked on the dopamine rush they get from various medias online,\nlets say youtube has videos and shorts, instagram posts and reels ( although ive never heard anyone\nuse them srsly ), tiktok is purely an addiction machine, twitter has a very good algorithm\nthat runs on rage ( yk the feeling when someone says something obv wrong and you correct it\nand yall keep talking abt it and none of you wants to give up ? )\nand so on, every big service runs on addiction and data collection, all are algorithm-ised,\npeople keep going down the addiction hole and companies keep mass mining their data and its just\nan infinite cycle of addiction and violating your freedom, privacy and so on until youre so deep down\nthe addiction hole you have no escape\n\n**bad education** about digital privacy and general IT is also a huge problem, digital privacy is\nbecoming more and more relevant as the new world is becoming more and more digital, companies\nget access to so much of our lives now its crazy, it sometimes feels like you can survive purely\nin that world and be just fine, almost every service has gone digital, from registering medical\napts to shopping, from entertainment to communication and so on, people arent aware of how much\ndata companies get and how much can be extracted from it and so on, people are so ignorant to the\nfact that data = power, also, IT education is also horrible, here in lithuania at least, its terrible,\nall we do is make word documents basically, in older classes we do get some more serious education,\nalthough its nothing serious, its mainly focused on specific proprietary software and how to use it,\nwhich\n\n- isnt applicable anywhere outside that specific software as its\n  usually 'so u press this, then that, then press this, drag that\n  and this is how u import a picture in word'\n- doesnt teach people anything\n- does not teach anything outside IT that isnt 'computer = word = windows = chrome = OS = number'\n\nits stupid how bad IT education is where everything is so digital\n\n**mental health problems** is also related to **ignorance**, some people are just so broken\nmentally they cant be bothered to give a fuck about anything, and not like social media with\nplastering of numbers, insecurities, triggers and addiction ( this is the PERFECT formula for\na social media site, make it cause mental health problems which eventually will lead to depression\nor something similar and then be the seemingly only remedy that will help it )\nwill make it better, so companies profit of that people ( not specific mentally ill people )\nlive in ignorance and they keep feeding into it\n\nand then theres **dependence**, even if people are fully aware people face issue of de-transitioning\nfrom that specific software or ecosystem, e.g. apple feeds of this with their hardware and software\nbeing so incompatible with everything, being so good at integrating their software and hardware\nand giving people such status ( tbh it feels like the apple ecosystem is just a huge cult ), or for\nexample friends and general social communication, i have this issue with discord, ive suggested multiple\nopen source alternatives to friends and even offered to build one myself, they refuse to switch no\nmatter what so im stuck using discord as i know how problematic discord is and how shit it is, how much\nof a data farm it is, how much it shoves nitro peoples asses, how much of a pedophilia problem it has\nand so on, i hate it, im also somewhat stuck on youtube, i had a project in the works which woulve\nbeen a good alternative to youtube, ive had it planned and stuff, but then just stopped working on it,\nalthough now its a mess and ive worked on it somewhat, a lot of UI and stuff, which i find distracting,\ni might rework it though, the problem im having is that it has so much content i watch and music and so on,\nits a nice service, although it works on my very hardened profile unlike discord so i can at least\nmitigate it more, with discord there isnt as much briar between it and me\n\nthe cycle of it continues, we need to unite if we want to have a free ( as in freedom ) world,\nelse we wont get out of this creepy data-driven idiocy, make it paid or something, but omg, i want\nmy data, you can have my money, but my data is very important to me and i dont trust this fucked up\nsystem\n\nanyway, hope i at least explained some of this enough for you to get worried enough and join me\nin the act of stopping companies abusing users data and actual digital freedom instead of false\nand misleading marketing which turns people into sheep to fall into their sheep farm\n\ncya\n",

      "content": "shit shit shit shit shit\n\ntoday has been **_shit_**, i hated existing at every moment of today,\nthere was nothing good about this\n\nfirst, short but painful day, i was tired today, shit ( but short ) lessons\nand just bad, then the first 2 classes were lithuanian, made my lithuanian\nteacher hate me, she even basically said for me to shut up, but yk, in a corporate\ntype of way, like 'stfu nobody cares' => 'please dont say anything else', i had to\npresent a thing with my group and i was stuttering, i was very stressed, i\ncant speak without stuttering when im stressed, i have to either talk really fast\nor i stutter, in this case both happened, my lithuanian teacher got pissed at me\nand now she probably hates me, then i had to rate my own work, i did my work, i\nworked with my group, i helped to manage the group and shit so i rated myself 4/10\nfor at least doing the work, then i realised my friend didnt like my opinion\nabout the thing i was presenting and probably another reason why the lithuanian\nteacher told me to stop talking mid way through my reading, so i corrected my grade\nfrom 4/10 to a 3/10, i could lie and give myself a 10/10 like most others, but i really\ndont want to get into trouble and just get an even worse grade than 3/10 lol, this is\nmy reasoning why i gave myself a 3/10 to my teacher ( translated from lithuanian to english ) :\n\n> 4/10, i was working but when i presented, i got very stressed and nervous about\n> it, i don't think i should get a 2 because i helped the team, worked,\n> did my part of the job and tried to organize the team\n> ( for example, i helped to assign tasks, tried to manage [ classmate's ] refusal to work,\n> i checked how things were going, etc.), but i dont know how well i did and it was\n> clear that the teacher didn't like my part,\n> so considering everything, i think i should get at least a passing grade -- 4.\n\n> 3/10 that + my opinion was bad\n\nmy opinion about the book i was presenting was this ( once again translated ) :\n\n> i did not like the book \"benedikto slenk\u0161\u010diai\" .\n> this book seemed superficial and boring to me .\n> the first chapter was not bad, as it talked about benedicts childhood,\n> but the other slenk\u0161\u010diai, when he grew up,\n> were tedious and i barely wanted to read them .\n>\n> in my opinion, the author described benedicts life in too much detail,\n> which could have been conveyed in a shorter way .\n> also, there are not enough interesting details in the book\n> that could inspire the reader to read further .\n> the last chapters ( slenk\u0161\u010diai ) were sad and poor, with a lot written about sex and love,\n> as if we hadnt read about it in recent years .\n> in my opinion, the author also described these\n> topics in too much detail, which could have been conveyed\n> in a shorter way, but with more interest .\n>\n> my final rating for this book would be 4/10,\n> because although the book is not the worst,\n> it does not have enough interesting details to captivate the reader .\n\nsame thing happened in art, except this time i had points to work with, still got a 3/10, but\neh, basically i had my work ( mosaic ) finished and the art teacher told me to rate myself, the\npoints ( every point has 2 points max ) were given to me and all i had to do was\nto rate myself, here are the points, scores and reasons i gave :\n\n-   methodical work in the lesson, preparation for the lesson\n    ( 1 point, i did work in the lesson but i kept forgetting my glue at home\n    so i borrowed my friends )\n-   originality, interpretation, search for ideas\n    ( 0 points, its literally just a paper with pieces of paper glued on representing\n    a stupid and badly made flower )\n-   artistry ( 0 points, its not artistic nor is it anything pretty )\n-   disclosure of topics ( 1 point, the theme was flower and its obviously a flower, but its badly made )\n-   technique ( 1 point, i mean i did glue pieces of paper on a sheet of paper )\n\nso yeah, conclusion to this is that i suck at school, i am a literal fucking failure,\ndidnt even manage to get a 4/10\n\nsince DOML #3 some shit happened too, for example i quit my IT club ( due to depression ),\ni quit therapy ( do i even deserve it lmfao ) and so on, fell back in and out of my depressive episode,\nbegun noticing how much hairloss im having, probably due to anorexia and shit,\ni keep having panic and anxiety attacks, nothing is good,\neverything in my life is going to shit and i cant to anything about it, but at least one funny\nthing happened which is how my physics teacher gave my notebook to the school psychologist\nwithout telling me ALL BECAUSE I WRITE IN SMALL LETTERS ONFG WHAT THE FUCK LMAO\n\ni think my friends also begun hating me, idk, they seem different to me, it feels like\nthey hate me for no reason and it seems to clear to me that they just dont like me\nanymore, i think i should stop talking to them but even then wouldnt that be rude\n\neverything makes me sad and / or feels like theyre hating me, its just\nshit\n\nin conclusion i suck, im stupid, everyone and -thing seemingly hates me\nand everything in my life is going to shit and i cannot do anything about it lmao\n\ngoodbye lol, cya next time ig\n",

      "content": "hello dear parents\n\ndo you suffer from doornotcloseitis ? well, there is no treatment for such an evil\ncondition, but, being the royal woman i am, im here to help, so please take some time\nout of your day and read this, this should help with your doornotcloseitis, this medical\ncourse was verified by the dda ( door and drugs association )\n\n## what is a door ?\n\na door is an important part of a building, it is a barrier that provides privacy, security,\nand protection from the elements, doors are typically made of wood, metal, or other materials,\nand can be opened and closed in various ways\n\ndoors are used to separate interior and exterior spaces,\nthey can be used to control the flow of people and goods, as well as to provide a sense of safety and security,\ndoors can also be used to provide ventilation, light, and sound insulation\n\ndoors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be designed to match the style of\na building or the specific needs of the user, they can be single or double-hinged, sliding,\nor folding, and can be fitted with locks, handles, and other hardware, many doors are also equipped\nwith sensors, alarms, and other security features.\n\ndoors play a vital role in the safety and security of a building,\nthey can be used to restrict access to certain areas, and can help to protect people and property from intruders,\nthey also provide a sense of privacy and security, making people feel more comfortable\nin their homes and workplaces\n\ndoors are an essential part of any building, they provide security, privacy, and ventilation,\nand can be designed to match the style of a building or the specific needs of the user\n\n## what is a door handle\n\na door handle is a device used to open and close a door, it is usually made of metal or plastic\nand is attached to the door with screws or bolts, most door handles come in two parts :\n\n-   the latch, which is the part that is pulled to open the door\n-   and the knob, which is the part that is turned to open and close the door\n\nthe latch is usually made of metal and is usually spring-loaded, so that when the knob is turned,\nthe latch slides back into place, the knob is usually made of plastic and is designed\nto be comfortable to grip\n\ndoor handles come in a variety of styles and finishes, some door handles are designed to match the decor of a room,\nwhile others are more utilitarian in design, there are also door handles that are designed to be decorative,\nsuch as those made of brass or bronze, many door handles also come with a keyhole,\nwhich allows a key to be inserted to open the door\n\ndoor handles provide a convenient way to open and close a door without having to use a key,\nthey are also a great way to add a touch of style to a room, door handles are an important part of any home\nand should be chosen carefully to ensure they are both functional and aesthetically pleasing\n\n## how do i close a door ?\n\nclosing a door is a simple task, but there are a few key steps to ensure that it is done properly\n\nfirst, stand close to the door and grab the handle, pull the door towards you firmly and make sure\nit is in the closed position, if the door has a lock, turn the knob or key to secure it, next,\ncheck that the door is completely shut, if it is not, push the door gently until it is fully closed\n\nfinally, if the door has a latch or lock, double-check that it is secure\n\nto ensure the door is closed properly, it is important to be aware of the environment around it,\nmake sure that there is nothing in the way of the door that could prevent it from closing,\nif there is, move it out of the way, additionally, check the hinges and frame to make sure\nthey are in good condition and that the door is not sticking or binding\n\nclosing a door is a simple task, but it is important to make sure that it is done properly,\nfollow the steps above to ensure that the door is closed securely and that it is not blocked by any objects,\nadditionally, inspect the hinges and frame to make sure they are in good condition,\ndoing all of these steps will help ensure that the door is closed properly and securely\n\n## conclusion\n\nhope this helped, if youre a parent i now sincerely hope you understand what a door is now and\nhope that your doornotcloseitis will be better from now on, i hope this helped and youll be\nthrilled to use your newfound knowledge from now on\n\nhave a nice one\n",

test, dont get me wrong, the test\nwas easy, i was doing okay, but each question was like 7 parts and there were 5 questions\nso i wasnt able to finish it in 30 minutes, i only managed to do 2.5 / 5 tasks, that\nmade me feel horrible and i couldnt stop thinking abt it, i almost had to leave school\nbc i was very shit mentally, it affected me so much for some reason, but oh well,\nig if i get a low grade ill just rewrite it in consultations :/, today i also found more\nbad traits abt my crush, i alrd knew hes an andrew tate stan bc he made a whole ass talk\nabt him in english class, the theme was 'my favourite person', but today in patriotism\nclass we were talking about women's rights and my crush was just making fun of it the\nwhole time, its just sad and cringeworthy, why did i fall for a guy that ( a ) doesnt\nlike me and ( b ) is a dickhead, i also ate too many calories today, wont give any numbers,\nbut it was quite a bit for me and that also added on top of everything today, its just\nugh ...\n\nmy pc fan broke, well, now its fixed, but thats one of the main\nreasons i havent been able to write here, i didnt have my pc, i could have\nwritten on my phone but it isnt the same plus my pdb database ( basically\njust a custom password database format ) was on my pc while it was being\nrepaired, i could have fixed it myself, but i didnt have the needed part, it cost\n52 euro and itd only come on 03/06, so i just took it to the repair shop, it\ngot done faster and it cost less -- 50 euro, as a bonus my broken keys got fixed\nso im happy, now i got a fully functional pc for cheaper than if i fixed it myself,\nplus i didnt risk anything lol soooooooooo\n\na couple of days ago, on monday, i asked myself why i hate pe so much, and i\nwrote a bit abt it sooo lemme tell you, i was stressed about pe as i have pe on mondays,\ni kept thinking and just was stressed beyond belief, i wrote about how this\nhappens every day i have pe, how im stressed and how it makes me feel bad mentally,\nthe first point i wrote about -- gendered groups, ig its more of a 'gendered education'\nthing, but at least here in lithuania its barely here besides, well, pe and arts and crafts\n( idk we call it technologies, but dont mix it up with informatics ), in arts and\ncrafts we can pick the gender group no matter the gender so its eh, i wrote about how\nit causes me gender dysphoria, thats one of the largest reasons it causes me stress,\nthen i wrote that it feels bad dressing out of uniform in school, 'its probably just my\nautism' i wrote, but eh, idk, its just that it feels bad being in a school environment\nbut dressed up this casually, it feels bad and it just idk, weird, but not like id\nlike to stay in my uniform doing pe anyway, itd stink, sweat and itd be uncomfy, so lol,\nalso i wrote that pe clothing is just too lose for me as im used to tight black clothing\nas thats my main 'style' if you can call it that, im also scared of pe assignments,\nim very weak physically and im terrified of a bad grade in pe, it makes me overthink\nif im good enough, strong enough for pe and makes me stressed, im scared of judgement,\nit feels like the teacher, the children and everyone in general is watching me and waiting\nfor me to fail so they could make fun of me, might be irrational, but idk, im not the only\none who feels this way, i know bc i asked, i also dont dress up in school, i come in with\npe clothing, but uniform on top ( its only a jumper ), when pe comes i just take off my\nschool uniform and thats it, i get underessed at home during the lunch break which for me\nis 40 minutes, after pe i feel gross and tired and it takes me around 2-3 classes before\ni fully recover, until then i am unable to work at my full capacity in turn making me inefficient\nand stupid, thus risking a bad grade once again, theres 0 positive things i can say abt pe,\nmy teacher is also most likely a pedophile, he stares at girls asses whenever he can get the chance,\nas im in the girls group, i joke abt him staring at my bony ass but its just sad how such\npeople have a job with kids, he also at test times forces me into the boys grp, so he expects\nto to perform as good as a buff ass kid who is having the time of his life, like who would win,\na depressed anorexic with crippling anxiety or a buff ass dude, its annoying, i cant take\nsuch load\n\nbut good news ...\n\ni dont have to do pe anymore, my doctor wrote me a paper that states that i cant do pe anymore\nand im super happy abt it, no more stress that kills me every monday and wednesday, its nice,\ni got that paper bc of my weight and other health problems\n\nthis whole week for me was mainly a depression hole, i mean still havent gotten out of it,\nbut idk, even my room reflects it lol\n\nprevious week i also got 2 diplomas or whatever, both for the IT contest i went to, i took\nthe 1 st places in both my school and my city, although not my country, but eh, oh well ig,\nits rare that anyone takes the 1 st place in the country part lol\n\nwell, i cant think of what much to say anymore, comment if you want, im happy to hear yalls\nopinions and stuff ig, well, cya next time which will probably be soon, cya :)\n",

      "content": "remember [this post ?](https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/i-came-out-to-my-psychologist/)\n\nso yeah, last week i couldnt meet up with my psychologist ( because stuff happened at home ), so i did this week, not too long ago i walked out of her office and even though\ni walked out sweating like a stressed pig, i feel ... good ? i mean it all went well, she was accepting,\nunderstanding, nice about it, but it was scary talking about me being trans in person, i have\nnever had to talk about it so much irl, new thing, a lot of anxiety and just aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\nshe said its fine and okay, she understands, she has trans clients in the past, she even asked for the name\ni go by, ~~although i couldnt say it because i was scared, ill tell her next week~~,\nshe used feminine pronouns on me this session and so on\n\nit was a lot to talk about, it was scary, i was in such a high state of stress, sweated, got shaky,\nfidgeted and stuff but now that im home, i think it was a good experience, im happy about it,\nim glad i finally opened up about my identity and that my psychologist accepted me for who i am,\nits a huge relief and im glad i was able to sorta do it\n\nshe also asked how does it feel to be trans and i couldnt really explain it, its \u2728 a feeling \u2728\nlike she asked me something along the lines of\n\n> are you a boy who just likes boys or are you a girl ? how does it feel to be trans ?\n\ni said that i am a girl and that its weird to explain how it is to be trans, i said like\n\n> it just feels that im not me, its weird to explain it\n\nor smt, i think a better explanation would be like\n\n> im a girl, it feels like like me fighting my own self, like i want to be accepted\n> but im also scared, i feel like im not a boy, i hate taking on masculine roles, i am not masculine\n> myself, i feel like nobody who is cis will understand what its like to be a trans person and the\n> struggles that come with it as its not a choice, for example, i feel like i should be in\n> the girls group if the teachers tell us to split into groups by gender\n> ( even though i think its quite bs but eh ) but i have to go the boys group\n> apparently ( like i have to fight myself ), i feel like im walking on eggshells to conceal\n> my identity and who i am trying to make sure im not offending anyone and not exposing myself\n> to just get bullied into even a deeper depression than i already am in\n\ni think this would have fit more, but i mean i have an alibi -- i was stressed beyond hell, i was sweating,\nmy heart and mind were racing, everything was just a whole ball of stress, i was sitting there in\na chair frozen, barely able to talk, although as we talked more about it i got more comfortable\n\ni think and hope next week i will be able to talk to her more about this topic and this conversation\nmade me realise, maybe i dont want to end my life yet afterall, maybe i just needed help, someone to talk\nto, after i had the convo i feel much better, its nice, although when my depression and gender dysphoria\nwill come back after such a high point for me in happiness, i will feel terrible\n\nbut oh well, at least the psychologist accepts me :)\n",

      "content": "as of now its 03:23 am in lithuania, i am writing this to just write something\ni dont feel like just staying in pure quiet, listening to the rain, feeling the\ncold, hearing my homeserver do stuff, decided to start this thing called `DOML`,\njust me writing about days of my life, what i am thinking and so on, normal\ncontent like tutorials, emotional stuff, sharing of open source news, opinions and\nso on wont go anywhere, but i want to have some sort of series on here, so why\nnot this, this will be a good practice for me to write text, get creative maybe,\nlearn more visual writing, expression and so on, should be nice\n\nright now im quite tired, but not really, its a weird feeling,\ni mean i would gladly go to bed, but i dont see the need for it really\nand i just dont want to sleep, idk, i got stuff to do for tomorrow, for example\nprepare for school, take a bath, clean and reorder my room, do my homework,\nread a shit ass book for school which i only read 49 pages of, im probably\nnot going to finish it in time but eh, who cares\n\nmy timetable for school changed, its shit, on monday i have pe as my first\nlesson, and i already ***REALLY*** hate pe, i mean i never liked this much physical\nwork, but then theres few things about pe that just make me die inside, from\nworst to 'eh idrc kinda idk' :\n\n- gender dysphoria\n    - the teacher makes us go into 'boys' and 'girls' groups and i am not\n      fully transitioned, although usually im in the girls group, but when\n      it comes to grading i get treated as a 'boy' ... i get the same tasks\n      as the buff kid in my class, i am a 38 kg stick, hes a muscly giant\n      who has been training non-stop for like 3 years \ud83d\udc80\n- anxiety\n    - every day, class, hour, minute, second, etc. before pe i get the worst anxiety,\n      during pe it usually worsens, but if i talk to my closer classmates, like\n      i dont like considering people friends really, but theyre just 'people i know'\n      usually, it gets better, but even after pe i still have \u2728 that feeling \u2728\n- pe makes me feel gross\n    - i dont dress up for pe in school as per the reason listed in the 1 st place,\n      i come to school with my pe clothing already on, on top of that my\n      uniform, which is just a jumper so i dont mind, but after pe i feel gross\n      and hot, so i just have to wait for like 2-3 ( or now, purely 3 ) classes\n      so i could go home, get my grossyness sorted out and dress up normally\n      in my lunch break ( which is 40 minutes, i usually come back at around the\n      30 mins mark )\n- hypocrisy of the teacher\n    - the teacher makes us do weird sports things and i never see him do any\n      of it, we always do it while he just stands there and watches us suffer,\n      everyone is dying, like even the healthy people, its even worse for\n      people who have shit health\n\nprobably more, but im too lazy to name it all, worse of all -- pe is a mandatory\nclass in lithuania, meaning you can just drop it, which is depressing, after pe on\nmondays i have psychology, which is such a noisy lesson usually as the teacher\ndoesnt really control the class 'traditionally' so to say, she talks, but she never\nsays anything/much if theres kids screaming or smt, so like, im tired and anxious after\npe and then ill have to deal with a loud class \ud83d\ude2b after that its all good on monday,\n2 math classes, lunch break, 2 chems and lithuanian grammar\n\non tuesdays my first lesson is technology, like crafts and stuff, i dont mind it too\nmuch, kinda a fine lesson, then physics and 2 german classes, after that lunch break,\n2 geographies and math, this is fine\n\nomg and then we have wednesdays, 2 lithuanian literature classes, so ill be\nexhausted, after that -- patriotism, which is basically just reading articles,\nlast thing i want after 2 straight hours of reading is more reading and then\nguess what, fucking pe, pe, omfg, then lunch break and then boom, math, theyre\ntrying to kill us fr and after that its okay ig -- music and biology\n\nthursday didnt really change much so idc, but friday is \u2728 no \u2728, 2 lithuanian\nliterature classes, then art ... in the middle of the day ... i had art as my last\nclass last semester and like art is such a lesson you get really out of it after\nit and you just dont feel like doing work anymore, but then they make us do\nenglish, i mean idrc as english is quite easy for me but eh, then lunch break and then\nthe slowest teacher's class of all -- 2 histories, the history teacher is so slow,\nistg, its like watching a youtube video on 0.25 speed \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b like its my last\nclasses and i cant wait to go home in my last classes and they just decided to make\nthem the longest \ud83d\ude2b\n\nso yeah, fun \ud83d\udc4d\n\ni also had plans to clean and reorder my room, i still do, but i find no energy\nfor it and if i do find the energy for it, i dont have the time or if i do have both,\ni dont have the brain power for it, for example on friday i was going to do it,\nbut i was exhausted, then got energetic again, went to my grandma, came back, family\nstarted being ass to me so i logically cried myself to sleep, thats how my 'cleaning\nand reordering of my room' went, i thought i was going to do it today, no, i didnt\nhave the time for it, i went out with my best friend and we spend like 4.5 hours\npreparing for her mothers birthday, she seemed happy ( her mother, and well bsf ig )\nso im fine, came back and had no energy, i mean as of now i have more energy, but i dont\nhave the brain power for it and also its like 4 am so lol, tmrw will probably not be\nmuch diff, ill have no energy for a fact and as im not doing well emotionally rn\ni dont think thatll go away tmrw, but oh well\n\nwhen i cried myself to sleep yesterday, it was just overwhelming, i was tiredish so i was\nmuch more vulnerable to emotions, then my parents started talking shit about me, then\nmy brothers started screaming, then my middle brother begun screaming antilgbt stuff to me,\nthen they both begun doing shit to annoy me, then my brain remembered \u2728 everything \u2728\nthen just then, i could add like 10000 `then`s and it would not be enough, so to just\nsummarise, it was too much, i broke in half and didnt want to live around anyone, so i\njust went to die temporarily by going to cry and falling asleep that way\n\nthen i woke up in the morning and started this day, although first regretted waking up\nlol\n\nthen my best friend texted me and well, we went out and did the stuff, this just\nloops around now\n\nomg, this blog post is consistent, i mean i didnt start from the beginning,\nbut its also not so much of a mind clutter as the 'idk something' blog, i mean it was\nintentionally just a clusterfuck of thoughts, but this is nice, i mean i kinda like\nthat i chose to not start from the beginning, i mean it wasnt intentional, but yk,\nstill kinda cool\n\nanyway, maybe you enjoyed this carousel, i will probably continue this series, although\nidk how consistent this will be, i just want this to be a thing, cya\n",

      "content": "i have been comparing myself to a lab rat for long, so here is\nhow it feels to be a living and free lab rat living amongst people\n\nlets start from why i even call myself a lab rat, i feel like i am\none, theres no better word, i could call myself a sick person or something\nbut that doesnt describe my feelings as well as 'lab rat' does, i feel\nlike everything being done to me, doctors, medicine, mental health\nstuff, hospitals, even talking to people sometimes feels like a lab\nexperiment and i am their test lab rat, this is what i mean :\n\nwhen it comes to doctors i feel that its super invasive, everything is being\noverdone, being called things and so on, apparently being anorexic means youre\nsuper hard to look at, it feels like they picked the worst specimen to see\nwhat would happen to a weak person if they had this treatment\n\nmedicine-wise it feels like im a test subject of all drugs, i have to drink\nmany, i hate drinking them, so i dont, at this point i dont give a single\nfuck, i am tired of this lab rat feeling, it affects my whole body, not only\nmy mental health, but physically i just feel much weaker when my mind is at\nlab rat stage, im never free from it\n\nmental health too, the same thing as to doctors applies here, it feels like\ntheyre talking to me just as a weird experiment, like a lab rat being\ntalked to on drugs to see how it affects the rat or something, like some\nweird ass research project that would change something, idk\n\nhospitals feel like lab rat cages to me, 4 blank walls, maybe 1 or 2 extra\npeople in the same room, single door, quiet, sterile, controlled, fed with\ndrugs and shit food, forced, no free will, prison, a cage, a lab rat cage,\ni just cant stand that, every year i have to stay in a hospital between a 1 week\nand 2 weeks bc of heart stuff, i hate that feeling, once they had no places\nin the hospital to stay for me, they let me go home, it was nice at least\n\nand when i talk to people, sometimes, it feels like theyre just doing it\nto see what happens, to see how will i respond to certain things, like say\nsome outrageous stuff about my beliefs or identity or just talk to me\nbecause im autistic or something, it just feels like theyre poking me around\nto see what moves, what doesnt, how i react, like giving rats different drugs\nto see how it affects their problem solving ability or something, like\ngiving it a maze, drugging it and telling it to solve it again, its stupid\n\nit feels like a living nightmare being a lab rat, i feel like im constantly being\nwatched, judged and experimented on, every decision i make, every move i make,\ni feel like im being monitored and judged, i feel like im being treated like an animal,\nlike im nothing more than a lab rat\n\ni feel like im being treated like a test subject being given drugs\nto see what happens and how i respond to them, like a game of poking around,\nlike im being manipulated and controlled, like im a puppet in some\nweird ass experiment\n\nim being treated like a specimen, like im nothing more than a test subject,\na lab rat, nothing more than a piece of living flesh and a pea sized brain to be poked,\ntested, monitored and just living a life of a lab rat stuck in a cage of life\n\ni feel like im constantly being tested, examined, like im nothing more than\na lab rat in a maze covered by a glass pane, i feel like im being treated like an object,\nlike im nothing more than a tool for someone elses gain, im im a lab rat,\nnothing more than an experiment\n\nim like a rat in a cage, im being observed and studied, im nothing more than\na specimen in an experiment, not even an experiment, just random, useless\npoking around for fun, like im nothing more than a test subject in a lab,\nin a cage, covered by a white sterile drape, with wires going out and in to my brain,\nmuscles, tissue, food and water\n\nthank you for listening to this rant kinda, now you know how it feels to be a living lab\nrat in a maze of life, maybe you can relate too, maybe both of us are just 2\nsad little rats, separated by a sterile, white cloth, well never see each other,\nbut at least we coexist <3\n",

like theres absolutely nothing i can think of putting\non there, personal projects go on my own github, which is like \u2728everything\u2728 so ... do i just make\nthe org and leave it empty lol ? i mean kinda a waste, idk\n\ni keep thinking about my psychiatrist, i found a person irl who goes to the same one as i do\nand theyre not having a good time like me, my psychiatrist is like a total unqualified bitch,\nleft her a few low/terrible ratings and 1 star reviews, if i could id give her 0 stars,\nshe doesnt even deserve the 1 star, idiotic shit\n\ngonna go to my grandma tmrw maybe, i wanna go for a walk, although its already pretty\nlate so if i dont fall asleep ill probably be dead tmrw lol, either way, i have\nnot been very energetic for the past couple of months lol\n\nngl overthinking is no, i overthink a lot and i keep getting mad at myself for\na lot of things, like what could have i said and stuff yk lol, this shit is even making\nme think to stop going to my psychologist, like i overthink the psychologist sessions\n***SO MUCH*** lol\n\nwatched a video a couple of weeks ago, it was about autistic trans ppl and as im an\nautistic trans person i was interested, seems like we, the autistic ppl, are 11 times\nas likely to be trans compared to an average person, its apparently also a sign of\nautism to have issues with your gender, which makes sense as i always had issues\nwith it, sad to know that 'its just a sign', but still, i also noticed that the time\npasses by faster the older i get lol, becoming a true grandma now\n\ni told my psychologist one thing, it was something like this, just in lithuanian obviously:\n\n> ill be honest, i hide some stuff from you and other doctors, the lithuanian mental\n> healthcare system fucking SUCKS A LOT, like A LOT A LOT, i have to lie or just hide\n> things from you because i dont want to get put into a mental hospital, mental stimulation\n> depravation makes my mind go into a \"bad mode\" which is literally what a mental hospital\n> is, i lied to you multiple times already to try to not get put into one and in lithuania\n> all they do is just shove you into a mental hospital and just give 0 shits about you\n\nso yeah lmao, lithuania fucking sucks for mental shit, getting mental healthcare is hard\nenough here, but getting proper mental healthcare is *impossible*, you have to watch your\nevery word if you dont want to just get shoved into a mental hospital, its fucking idiotic\n\ni kinda like this mind cluster-fuck of a blog post, its nice just thinking of shit and\njust typing it out lol\n\na person gave me a question idr how long ago but it was\n\n> if youre so depressed why dont you kill yourself already\n\nwell, i still want to see what life can offer until my ultimate demise, i mean\nso far it isnt anything good lol, but oh well\n\nwas watching my hands like a week ago and i found that they look a lot like frog hands, like\nthe bones and shit, fingers, just  f r o g  lol\n\ntoday i saw how bloated rust is, so, i shrunk my `/` part to `20 GB` few days ago and it was\nfine and uh, i decided to start my system update today and rust source code takes up 11+ GB\nof storage, funny because firefox takes up much less while being a much more complex program,\ngod, rust is a fucking disappointment lol\n\nremember how i was bald last year ? i was gonna shave my head again, then decided not\nto lol, it was a whole mess, i was scared, thought id probably feel good for a split\nsecond, but then like shit and then just polls and shit and ugh it was a mess, i just\ndecided to keep my hair, glad i did\n\nhm, im digging deeper and deeper into my brain, we went from christmas to this, interesting,\ni mean thats kinda what this blog is, me digging deeper and deeper into my 1 braincell width\nbrain lol\n\nim confused why ppl still use arigram, a telegram client i made, i mean its nice and stuff\nbut its kinda a deadish project, i dont work on it anymore, meaning the new stuff telegram\nadds is just going to show up as `[MessageUnsupported]` which isnt useful is it lol, i rlly\nneed to change the arigram api to work better with the new telegram shit dynamically lol, i\nmean i literally use arigram myself and it doesnt bother me but i mean others might not be\nable to work with it as well as i can lol\n\nlol im still on the `5.16.7` kernel, i dont like `5.15.x` and the new kernel sucks so im\nsticking to the old one and probably never updating, that is *if* im even staying on linux\nlol, remember, the netbsd/openbsd thing ?\n\nwhy does PE *(physical 'education')* even exist, 'movement' my ass, i came to school not to\n'move' but to learn and get a diploma, i literally am so exhausted after PE, can barely learn,\ni fucking hate PE, it makes me feel like shit in so many ways i cant, at times i even begin\nto cry BECAUSE i have PE that day, its stupid stupid lol, reasons why i hate pe:\n\n- dysphoria\n- exhaustion\n- pure depression\n- the general fucking feel of the 'lesson'\n- pointless 'lesson'\n- i fucking hate pe\n- i fucking hate pe\n- i fucking hate pe\n\ni might still be falling for my crush and ppl know lol, worst part is that were classmates,\nand like omg, why, i WANT to get over him but i just \u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728cannot\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728 lol, i have\na hard time dropping feelings for ppl\n\nanyway i think this clusterfuck of a blog is good enough to be posted if you decide\nto say anything abt it dont scream kthxbye\n",

      "description": "gnu bash optimization tips, and overall code, but mainly bash bc thats sometimes important lol",
      "content": "Over the years that I have been programming I had quite a few\nmoments when I had to optimise code, so today I have decided to share\nhow I do it, you might find this useful\n\n## BASH script optimisation\n\n> Note: A lot of these points can be also applied to the next\n> section\n\n-   Avoid forks and sub-shells, it might not look like much but it **_REALLY_** impacts\n    your program's performance, like... By a lot, so avoid them\n    -   Prefer using built-in BASH commands (<#:Example 1>)\n        rather than calling external commands\n        - Some `builtin`s are faster than others (<#:Example 12>)\n    -   Prefer using the `-v` syntax rather than using a sub-shell, capturing\n        the output and saving it, by `-v` syntax I mean\n        a command writing _directly_ to the variable (<#:Example 2>)\n    -   Prefer using native BASH rather than calling commands (<#:Example 3>)\n-   Avoid looping, as in any interpreted programming language it's slow to\n    loop in BASH\n-   Avoid complex commands (<#:Example 4>)\n    -   Avoid complexity in general even if it sacrifices ease (<#:Example 5>)\n    -   Be smart about the commands you call, call simpler ones (<#:Example 6>)\n-   Less is more, if you're not using BASH features, why not stick to `sh` ?\n    It's faster, or even use some other POSIX complient shell, for example DASH\n    or KSH\n-   If your code is being `source`d or in general, why not have a pre-processing\n    or build step, for example let's say you have optional logging enabled by some\n    environment variable, why not make that build-time, for example\n    <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/baz> does it, strip away comments and stuff\n    -   While you're at it, why not mangle names at build time to\n        be shorter ? Shorter scripts from what I know run _slightly_ faster\n        as BASH has to read less and parse less\n-   Avoid disk I/O (<#:Example 7>)\n-   Store data in variables rather than generating it over and over again\n    for example BASH escapes `$'\\n'`, it gives a _very slight_ performance\n    boost (<#:Example 8>)\n-   Prefer doing everything in one rather than one-by-one (<#:Example 9>)\n\n## General code optimisation\n\n-   Prefer compilation, transpilation or pre-evaluation over\n    pure interpretation\n    -   Even if the transpilation is into bytecode, it doesn't matter,\n        it'll still be faster than pure interpretation, for example\n        python bytecode is faster than raw python\n-   Buffering is underrated, calling many `syscall`s is expensive,\n    have a larger buffer instead ! (<#:Example 10>)\n-   Prioritise simplicity over ease, abstractions often cause\n    more complex code\n-   Use low level code, it's much faster than pure abstractions\n    -   Low level code gives you more control and is closer\n        to hardware meaning is much faster than machine-generated\n        assembly with preparation steps and things, you can do\n        just what you want with low level code, although it's not\n        easier, simple, but not easy\n-   Prefer smaller size, smaller assembly instructions and registers\n-   Find faster ways to do things, there always is at least one\n    (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1135679/does-using-xor-reg-reg-give-advantage-over-mov-reg-0>)\n-   Prefer doing less for a similar result (<#:Example 11>)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\n    x=\"$(cat -- /etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    x=\"$(</etc/passwd)\"\n\n### Example 2\n\n    greet() { echo \"Hello, $1\"; }\n\n    x=\"$(greet 'ari')\"\n    echo \"$x\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    greet() {\n        local -n _r=\"$1\"\n        shift 1\n\n        printf -v _r \"Hello, %s\" \"$1\"\n    }\n\n    greet x 'ari'\n    echo \"$x\"\n\n### Example 3\n\n    x=\"Hel o\"\n    echo \"$x\" | sed 's/ /l/'\n\nFaster:\n\n    x=\"Hel o\"\n    echo \"${x/ /l}\"\n\n### Example 4\n\n    printf '%s\\n' 'hey'\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo 'hey'\n\n### Example 5\n\n    x=()\n\n    while read -r line; do\n        x+=(\"$line\")\n    done <file\n\nFaster:\n\n    mapfile -t x <file\n\n### Example 6\n\n    sed '1!d' file\n\nFaster:\n\n    head -n1 file\n\n### Example 7\n\n    id >/tmp/x\n    echo \"Info: $(</tmp/x)\"\n    rm -f /tmp/x\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo \"Info: $(id)\"\n\n### Example 8\n\n    for _ in $(seq 10000); do\n        echo \"Hello\"$'\\n'\"world\"\n    done\n\nFaster:\n\n    nl=$'\\n'\n\n    for _ in $(seq 10000); do\n        echo \"Hello${nl}world\"\n    done\n\n### Example 9\n\n    while read -r line; do\n        echo \"$line\"\n    done <file\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo \"$(<file)\"\n\n### Example 10\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        ;; 2 syscalls per char\n\n        mov eax, 0\n        mov edi, 0\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1\n        syscall\n\n        test eax, eax\n        jz .exit\n\n        mov eax, 1\n        mov edi, 1\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1\n        syscall\n\n        jmp _start\n\n    .exit:\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable writable\n        buf: rb 1\n\nFaster:\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        ;; 2 syscalls per 1024 chars\n\n        mov eax, 0\n        mov edi, 0\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1024\n        syscall\n\n        test eax, eax\n        jz .exit\n\n        mov edx, eax\n\n        mov eax, 1\n        mov edi, 1\n        mov esi, buf\n        syscall\n\n        jmp _start\n\n    .exit:\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable writable\n        buf: rb 1024\n\n### Example 11\n\n    int x = 0;\n    x = 0;\n    x = 1;\n    x--;\n    x++;\n\nFaster:\n\n    int x = 1;\n\n### Example 12\n\n    content=\"$(cat /etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    content=\"$(</etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    mapfile -d '' content </etc/passwd\n    content=\"${content[*]%$'\\n'}\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    read -rd '' content </etc/passwd\n\n^ This exists with code `1`, so just add a `|| :` at the end if that's unwanted behaviour\n",

      "description": "a tutorial on how to make ur first website",
      "content": "A lot of people want to have a personal space and property on the internet,\nbut a lot of them don't know how... So today I'm going to be showing you\nhow you should go about making a website\n\nAlso, you should not straight up copy everything here,\nyou should just read it and use it as a rough outline, you should\nnever copy off tutorials or anything of sort\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\n> Keep it minimal, simple and avoid using bloat, also make sure to\n> keep going rather than giving up, learn rather than use some shit\n> service, experience with code also helps\n\n## Have prior programming experience\n\nYou'll need to have prior programming experience to understand what is really\ngoing on even though nor HTML nor CSS (the bare base of your website) are programming\nlanguages, many answers you'll find online will also use terminology that you won't\nunderstand if you don't have at least a bit of it\n\nEven if you don't have prior programming experience, please don't resort to website\nbuilders or static site generators, it won't teach you anything, rather\nlearn some programming language like python or even JavaScript, JavaScript alongside\nHTML and CSS is a huge part of the web stack\n\nAnyway, if you don't have any experience, gain some and then come back, unless\nyou want to just have a read, then go ahead :) Although without it, you won't\nget too far probably\n\n## Learn basic HTML and CSS\n\nFirst up, before you can do anything you'll probably want to learn HTML,\nto style it you'll probably want to learn CSS, although I have recommend\nthis to many people, they seem to not understand what learning is, they\nfind a tutorial and copy off it and then end up using inline `style` attrs\nor `style` tags in html, they begin making their HTML messy and invalid\nand generally make their site so messy and broken it becomes an unmaintanable\nmess, so what you should do\n\n-   Learn what HTML and CSS are, you need like 10 mins to look up the definitions and stuff\n-   Learn HTML\n    -   It can be learned in max 2 hours, a good tutorial I recommend: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg>\n    -   Don't copy from the tutorial, make sure to understand what you're doing\n-   Learn CSS\n    -   Look up a basic tutorial (e.g. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PnVor36_40>)\n    -   Once again **_DON'T COPY_**, understand and do\n\nOnce you have the bare minimum, make a simple HTML document and save it,\nthis will serve you the purpose of archiving your progress and you'll be able to\nsee how much you reached in like a month\n\nTo help you get started, here's quite a good template to start with:\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n        <head>\n            <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n            <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n            <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n            <title>Your title</title>\n\n            <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your description\" />\n            <meta\n                name=\"keywords\"\n                content=\"your, keywords, idk something, website, aaaa\"\n            />\n            <meta\n                name=\"robots\"\n                content=\"follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large\"\n            />\n            <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n\n            <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"dark\" />\n            <!-- ^^^ dark theme -->\n\n            <link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\" />\n        </head>\n\n        <body>\n            <!-- Your markup -->\n        </body>\n    </html>\n\n## JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is a programming language made for the web, or at least is a huge part of the\nweb stack, but these days it can run even serverside code using nodejs, but JavaScript (JS/js)\nis quite painful to code in, so if you want a better experience with programming on\nthe internet for your website try TypeScript (TS/ts) out\n\nYou'll use JavaScript to handle logic on your website, for example if you want to check\nwhat a user has entered in a text box or managing state(s)\n\nAlthough JS or TS are more than optional, hell, even CSS is optional,\nbut if you want to make your site at least slightly nice you'll probably want\n_at least_ CSS\n\n## Never say \"it's too hard\"\n\nAfter all of this, many people (including quite a few of my friends) would (or are) say\n\"it's too hard\" and resort to using some site builder with WIX or use a static site\ngenerator which bloats up your site to unbelievable levels, \"it's easier\" you'll say,\neven though this will end up making your site low-key shit and you'll have to deliver\nmegabytes of content to your website visitors which is not pleasant for anyone, nor you\nhosting it (we'll get to it later) nor the user visiting it, especially if they have\na bad internet connection, it doesn't teach you anything either, just bad in general,\nplease keep pushing, you can do it\n\nAlso, most web frameworks also cost a shit-ton of money and have mannnyyy hidden\nfees and spyware, so just stay away from them\n\n## Avoid frameworks\n\nFrameworks, although useful when you understand what everything means, don't teach you\nanything, and once again bloat up your site\n\n## Separate and track your learning\n\nBy separating and tracking your learning progress you'll see how much\nyou reached, how you improved and what you did to improve, you will also\nhave a great resource to\n\n## Manual is better (usually)\n\nIf you do most things manually (as in not using too many frameworks) you'll gain more\nknowledge and make your site smaller and simpler overall, I prefer to do things manually\nand I made my site quite small, while frameworks (e.g. react or bootstrap (they are not comparable, but just examples))\ntend to be huuuuggggeee in size, meaning your users will have to a) depend on 3rd party\ncode and make your site worse and even then, if you're using the framework you are,\nyou're learning the framework, not the actual logic (e.g. if you're using bootstrap, you're\nlearning bootstrap, not CSS)\n\nAlthough, note the _(usually)_, for example this blog is generated by my own\nstatic site generator which optimises stuff and makes it accessible for everyone,\nit doesn't bloat anything up, so if you have something like this (a blog), I'd\nsuggest writing your own or using a small static site generator, at least from\nthat you learn something\n\nThis blog generator is quite simple, creation of a blog is like\n\n> Markdown + text -> base64 encoding -> JSON\n\nAnd generation\n\n> JSON -> base64 decoder -> markdown -> HTML -> minification -> index.html file in a designated directory\n\n## Writing your site\n\nAfter all of this, you probably have few documents you can refer to,\nthis will be a great resource for you if you forget something, but don't be\nscared to look things up, it's normal and a part of a developer's experience,\nnobody, and I mean _nobody_ in 2022 knows how to center a div without\nlooking it up lol\n\nBut, besides that, here's a few tips to help you\n\n-   Automate only if needed\n    -   For example if you have something like a blog with many pages\n-   Don't focus on SEO, this will only make your site worse\n    -   Although basic SEO is fine, like adding a `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt` or something\n    -   Don't add like a milion `meta` tags too, just like 10 at max is good enough\n-   Focus on A11y (accessibility), because it's quite important for your site to be accessible to anyone, try using:\n    -   Semantic elements\n    -   CSS media queries\n    -   Accessible design\n    -   ARIA attrs\n-   Less is more, don't (over)use (over)complicated logic and frameworks with huge sizes, use little to get the result you desire\n-   Every little thing matters, especially on the web, every little bit of performance matters\n    -   Asset optimisation is good, but make sure to not overdo it to the point only the newest browsers can run it\n        -   For example asset optimisation _at build time_ is an amazing example of much needed asset optimisation,\n            although optional if you don't really care\n        -   Server-side gzip compression also helps\n        -   Image compression helps, quite a needed one especially if you have many images\n        -   Bundling can and does help, but isn't super major and plus can break some functionality\n    -   And don't forget about logic and CSS optimisation\n-   Don't add tracking, it just introduces security vulns, bloat, distrust and general bad things\n-   New technology can wait, let it develop and be supported amongst more browsers\n-   Just like when you were learning, don't be scared to separate content into different folders and files\n    -   Fun thing: if you want a page without `.html` at the end just, make a directory with the page name you want and\n        have `index.html` in it, but your server might support doing that automatically :)\n-   Have a place to test and run your site temporally\n    -   A dev server is important, because `file://` is usually not a good place to test it, use like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), I use it and I like it personally\n-   Use a VCS\n    -   Although doesn't _mean_ you have to make it open source (although you should (we'll talk about it)),\n        you should still use a VCS, `git` is probably the most popular one, while building your site you're going to have many fuck-ups\n        and you'll want to say \"eh, fuck it\" and reset all of your changes, well, without a VCS.. Good luck lol\n        -   But this means you will have to learn a VCS, no, a VCS is not 'press upload button to GitHub', use the CLI\n\nThese are some things I could thing of, I use them all lol, anyway, let's continue\n\n## Open source\n\nMany people would say 'WhO tHe fUcK nEEdS thE sOurCE cODe oF A sItE' and that's just an idiotic\nmindset to say the least, anyway, here's some good things that come with making your website\nopen source\n\n-   You're helping the open source community grow\n-   You're showing all changes you make to the public\n-   It's basically free advertising\n-   You show what your site does to the public, meaning it creates the feeling of trust\n-   You feel more accomplished when you show something to people and they like it\n\n> _also if your point of not making it open source is just 'just open the dev tools'\n> you're stupid, but you know what, okay then, send me the source code of google\n> to my email, would be appreciated.. Oh waitttt you can't because it's not the full\n> assets, it's obfuscated and minified and plus it's probably modified_\n\n## Hosting\n\nHosting is when you actually let people see the stuff you made, hosting your code is one thing,\nbut hosting your site is another, I personally use [netlify](https://netlify.com/), it's an amazing, free and non-scummy\nplatform for hosting your _static_ site, it also provides amazing [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/),\n[help](https://answers.netlify.com/) and [customisation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/)\nand all of this for free, although more limiting, a good choice is also [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)\npages\n\nAlthough I think out of those 3 netlify is the best choice for _static_ sites :)\n\nBut if you want something server-side, I doubt you'll be able to find anything\nfree, but this is not a\n\n## Publicising and sharing\n\nDon't be annoying about it and don't shove it into everyone's face, just add it to\nyour bio, put it on something like [wiby](https://wiby.me/) and be happy, it's not a competition,\njust make fun things and people will like it :)\n\nYou can also share it with your friends and other strangers which are interested\n\n## What can you do on your site\n\n-   Host files\n-   Make a blog\n-   Have fun with code\n-   Explore random frameworks (when you already know what you're doing)\n-   Talk to people\n-   Share your projects, thoughts and opinions\n-   Learn !\n\n## Don't allow people to get in your way\n\nNot everyone is going to like your site, if they call it shit, who cares,\nit's your place to do anything, for example would you burn your house down if\nsomeone didn't like it, it's yours, you're good with it and you need to enjoy\nit, it's your own property, just virtual\n\n## Domain name\n\nDomain names are _really_ optional as most hosting services provide\na subdomain, e.g. <https://ari-web.netlify.app/>, but you might like having\nyour domain like <https://ari-web.xyz/> which is shorter and just nicer,\nfor domains you will have to pay, for example buy it from <https://namecheap.com/>,\nbut there are services which provide free domains to people, those domains\nhave very low value though, like .tk and .ga are usually flagged as untrustworthy\nand don't grow as fast\n\nAfter you get a domain name you might want to set up HTTPS (if you don't already\nhave it) and submit it to the HSTS preload list which will ensure the security\nof users visiting your site\n\n## That's about it\n\nWell... That's about it, it's a long process and getting it more popular is even\nharder, but don't try hard, don't be annoying about it to people and just make\nthings you like and people will find it, anyway, hope you found this blog useful\nand I inspired you to join the web world, hope to see another web neighbour in the\nnear future :)\n\nHave a nice day and goodbye :)\n",

Try `kos`,\nit's smaller than `doas` and obviously `sudo`, much faster, doesn't use PAM,\nquite secure from what I see, has good compile-time customisation and\ngenerally is a good alternative to at least `doas`, it works for me, works\nfor many other people so should work for you :)\n\nI personally have been using it for quite a while and it's good,\ntry it out if you feel like it :)\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/kos>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/kos>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/kos>\n-   Arch package: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kos>\n\n## `Lmgr` license manager\n\nI find it so annoying to manually license every single one of my projects,\nI now use `lmgr`, I just got a bunch of license templates set up and it's\neasy, I'm happy I made it\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/lmgr>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/lmgr>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-misc/lmgr>\n\n## `Mkproj` project templater\n\nAlongside `lmgr`, `mkproj` comes in handy, it's super annoying to me personally\ndo things manually and if I want to make a project `mkproj` really helps lol\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkproj>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/mkproj>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-misc/mkproj>\n\n## `Mkqemuvm` -- the small QEMU wrapper\n\nI usually don't change my QEMU vm options that often so I just made a script\nto help me make QEMU VMs easily:\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkqemuvm>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/mkqemuvm>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-emulation/mkqemuvm>\n\n## `Pwdtools` tools for passwords\n\n`pwdtools` is another thing I quite often use, I use it to generate, store\nsometimes validate the security of passwords, it's nice, quite useful\n\nThis includes 2 password validators, password generator and a password manager,\nmight add more :)\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/pwdtools>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/pwdtools>\n\n## `Filetools` tools for files\n\nAlthough `filetools` isn't as useful to me, it's nice to get good info about\ncertain files, like permissions, path info, owner, size, etc. super nice\nfor development too\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/filetools>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/filetools>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/filetools>\n\n## `Bdwmb` -- the modular bar for DWM\n\nThe heading says it all, it's a simple, small and nice bar for\nDWM window manager, I use it, I like it lol\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/bdwmb>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/bdwmb>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/x11-misc/bdwmb>\n\n---\n\nThat's about it, although this is definably not all, just most major, I also\nrun my own stuff on top of those so my system is basically just my software,\nanyway, hope I introduced you to some of my software somewhat, anyway, have a\ngood day :)\n\nGoodbye\n",

      "description": "mpv is my beloved player so i decided to collect some shit on myself lol",
      "content": "## Before we start\n\nThis blog is not updated, I made this whole thing into a baz\nplugin: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mpvp-report>\n\nA day ago I started collecting data about what I listen to\non my playlist, and currently it's working out amazing, it's very\nfun, so I thought to myself, 'why not share it', so here\nyou go\n\n## 1. Set up `mpvp` alias\n\n`mpvp` alias is what you will have to use to collect data about\nyour playlist, you can set up another name but code should be\naround the same\n\nBasically, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n    mpvp_collect() {\n        [ ! -f \"$HOME/.mpvp\" ] && : >\"$HOME/.mpvp\"\n\n        sleep 2\n\n        while true; do\n            sleep 5\n\n            x=\"$(echo '{ \"command\": [\"get_property\", \"path\"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvipc)\"\n\n            [ ! \"$x\" ] && break\n\n            if [ \"$x\" ] && [ \"$x\" != \"$(tail -n 1 \"$HOME/.mpvp\")\" ]; then\n                sleep 4\n\n                y=\"$(echo '{ \"command\": [\"get_property\", \"path\"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvipc)\"\n                [ \"$x\" = \"$y\" ] && echo \"$x\" >>\"$HOME/.mpvp\"\n            fi\n        done\n    }\n\n    alias mpvp='mpvp_collect & mpv --shuffle --loop-playlist --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvipc'\n\nWhen you use the `mpvp` alias it'll start the data collector in the background,\nthe IPC will be accessible though `/tmp/mpvipc`, this will collect all\ndata to `~/.mpvp`, listen to some music and ignore it for a bit, also, keep in mind,\nthis code is bad because I'm too lazy to improve it and I made it fast, anyway, you\nneed to install `socat` for this to work\n\n## 2. Generate data report\n\nWell at this point you can do anything you want with your data, although\nI made a simple generator for it\n\nSo I made use of the data I have and my playlist structure, here's an example entry:\n\n    {\"data\":\"playlist/girl in red - i'll die anyway. [8MMa35B3HT8].mp3\",\"request_id\":0,\"error\":\"success\"}\n\nThere's an ID there so I add YouTube adding to the generator by\ndefault, yours might not have it, but I mean, you can still pretty much\nuse it, just links won't work\n\n### 2.1 The script\n\nI made a python script as my generator:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    \"\"\"MPV playlist song

from, run the script,\njust\n\n    python3 main.py\n\nOr whatever, it'll generate `index.html` file and it'll include all of\nyour report data, you can also style it using the `styles` variable\n\n## 3. Finishing\n\nThat's all, enjoy your statistics, and as of now I shall go collect more data,\nI already have 18KB of it!\n\nPlus, I'll admit it, most of this code is **garbage, complete dog shit**,\nI just wanted to make it work and I did, it's readable enough\nfor just a messy script I'm not even releasing as anything legit\n",

      "content": "Ari-web APIs recently have become public, meaning\nanyone can use them on anywhere, so, how should you\nuse them properly?\n\n## 1. Validate hashes\n\nAll APIs have hashes for validation, and APIs are much more\nexpensive to call than just comparing two hashes\n\nFirst up make an uncached request, cache the request, then\nmake a request to get the calculated hash, cache it too\n\nNext time only make a request to get the hash, if the hashes\nmatch, if they do, use the cached API response, if it does\nnot match, get the updated data, cache it and so on\n\n### Hashes\n\nThe hashes are sha256 sums of the APIs, here's all the APIs\nhashing system\n\n-   <https://files.ari-web.xyz/files.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://files.ari-web.xyz/files_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/blog.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/blog_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api_hash/..._hash.txt> with the `...` being the API name with all `.` characters replaced with `_`, for example for <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api/sitelist.json> would be <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api_hash/sitelist_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://etc.ari-web.xyz/pages.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://etc.ari-web.xyz/pages_json_hash.txt>\n\nThis is already a standard in Ari-web, also if `www` subdomains don't work,\ntry out removing `www`\n\n## 2. Make as little requests as you can\n\nThis is kinda an extension of point 1, just don't make 10\nrequests to every API if you only need the `sitelist.json` once for\nexample\n\n## That's it\n\nThat's it, I got nothing else, this whole blog could have been\njust\n\n    Make as little and I mean AS LITTLE requests as possible to the APIs\n",

      "content": "So before we start, I have my own overlay @ <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>\nand am running it for a while, it was a bit painful for me to\nmake one at the start and to help new Gentoo users I am making this\nblog post, anyway, here's how you do it:\n\n## Step one -- Think of a name\n\nThink of a name you will give your overlay because this information\nwill be needed in later steps\n\n## Step two -- Folder structure\n\nTo start with we need files and folders to work with,\nall names ending with a `/` are folders and everything\nelse is a file, please make sure to also apply the templates\nin `<...>`, for example `<year>` would be the current year:\n\n    ./\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 metadata/\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 layout.conf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 overlays.xml\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 profiles/\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 repo_name\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 repositories.xml\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sets/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sets.conf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 <overlay name>.conf\n\n## Step three -- License\n\nThe `LICENSE` file should have your license, if it doesn't\nalready please pick one, for example on my overlay\nI went for [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), but you can also go for some other\n_open source_ licenses, like GPLv2, WTFPL, BSD 3-clause, etc.\n\nWrite that license to the `LICENSE` file\n\n## Step four -- Master overlays\n\nThis step is always the same, you have to set the master\noverlay in `metadata/layout.conf` file, the master is usually\ngoing to be `gentoo`, so in `metadata/layout.conf` add this\ncontent:\n\n    masters = gentoo\n\n## Step five -- Overlay index files\n\nOverlay index files are these files:\n\n- `overlays.xml`\n- `repositories.xml`\n\nBoth of these files should have the same content,\nmake sure to fill in the templates that are in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE repositories SYSTEM \"https://www.gentoo.org/dtd/repositories.dtd\">\n    <repositories xmlns=\"\" version=\"1.0\">\n        <repo quality=\"experimental\" status=\"unofficial\">\n            <name><![CDATA[OVERLAY_NAME]]></name>\n            <description lang=\"en\"><![CDATA[OVERLAY_DESCRIPTION]]></description>\n            <homepage>OVERLAY_HOMEPAGE</homepage>\n            <owner type=\"project\">\n                <email>OWNER_EMAIL</email>\n                <name><![CDATA[OWNER_FULL_NAME]]></name>\n            </owner>\n\n            <!--\n                Optional (this is an example because it's hard to template it):\n\n                <source type=\"git\">https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <source type=\"git\">git://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <source type=\"git\">git@github.com:TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <feed>https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay/commits/main.atom</feed>\n            -->\n        </repo>\n    </repositories>\n\nOnce again, don't forget that all of these files have the same exact content,\nand no, it cannot be a symlink AFAIK\n\n## Step six -- Profiles\n\nYou only need one file in the `profiles` folder -- `repo_name`,\nthe content of it should be your overlay name, for example:\n\n    dinolay\n\nThis is the `repo_name` content on my own overlay, basically the\ntemplate is\n\n    <overlay name>\n\n## Step seven -- Readme\n\n`README.md` is an optional file, it's just used for information to give to users,\nit can have any content but here's a nice template:\n\n    # <overlay name>\n\n    > <overlay description>\n\n    ## Installation\n\n    ### Manual\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/portage/repos.conf\n    $ sudo cp <overlay name>.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/<overlay name>.conf\n    $ sudo emerge --sync '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\n    ### Eselect repository\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo eselect repository add '<overlay name>' '<overlay sync method (e.g. git)>' '<overlay sync url>'\n    $ sudo eselect repository enable '<overlay name>'\n    $ sudo emerge --sync '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\nAnd once you get into the [Offical Gentoo API](https://api.gentoo.org/), for example\n[Like I did](https://github.com/gentoo/api-gentoo-org/pull/459) you also add how to add your overlay through\n[layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman):\n\n    ### Layman\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo layman -a '<overlay name>'\n    $ sudo layman -s '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\n## Step eight -- Sets\n\nThis directory is optional, although you can have sets\nof packages in there, like have you ever heard a term called\n'world set', it's the same thing, just on your own overlay\n\n[Read more about it here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets)\n\n## Step nine -- Sets configuration\n\nThis file is needed unlike the sets directory, you should\nhave this content in it, although once again, please don't\nforget to fill in the template:\n\n    [<overlay name> sets]\n    class = portage.sets.files.StaticFileSet\n    multiset = true\n    directory = ${repository:<overlay name>}/sets/\n\n## Step ten -- Portage overlay configuration\n\nThis file, although optional, will help the users of your\noverlay so much, they can just download this file,\nput it in `/etc/portage/repos.conf/<repo name>.conf` and then\nrun\n\n    sudo emerge --sync '<repo name>'\n\nAnd they have it installed, anyway, this is what that file\nshould have\n\n    [<overlay name>]\n    location = /var/db/repos/<overlay name>\n    sync-type = <overlay sync type>\n    sync-uri = <overlay sync url>\n\nE.g. for git it'd be:\n\n    [<overlay name>]\n    location = /var/db/repos/<overlay name>\n    sync-type = git\n    sync-uri = https://some.git.service/me/my-overlay.git\n\n## Finishing\n\nAnd that's it, you can now publish your overlay on for example\nGitHub, like I did on <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>, it's very easy,\nif you are confused about anything, refer to that repo yourself\n",

      "content": "## Projects\n\nDon't ask me about the names, ari-web came from how I name my hostnames\nwhile using Linux distros like ari-<distro\\> so it only makes sense that\nari-web would be for my website ig, other names I just made up ig, I really\nhave 0 clue what they mean but yeah, also I only created my GitHub account\nin 2020/09/10, meaning I have not released too much, usually my projects used\nto be smaller scale, the most I did was share them on discord or something,\nbut also there's the issue that I have deleted over 50 of them from github\nbecause they're.. Very useless\n\n- Ari-web things\n    - [Main page](https://ari-web.xyz/) -- The actual main page, source code: <https://ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Blog](https://blog.ari-web.xyz/) -- My.. Blog ig lol, but actually is managed and built unlike the legacy counterpart, source code: <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/git>\n        - [Legacy blog](https://legacy.blog.ari-web.xyz/)-- Why do people even read this, I have not updated it in like half a year, source code: <https://legacy.blog.ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Comments and opinions](https://user.ari-web.xyz/) -- Literally just a static page using uterances for people to comment stuff on rather than flooding me with github issues, source code: <https://user.ari-web.xyz/git> (nothing interesting)\n    - [School stuff](https://school.ari-web.xyz) -- Very bad and cringe, also not foss\n    - [(Mainly personal) File hosting](https://files.ari-web.xyz/) -- A place where I upload files because using conventional file uploading services like filebin is annoying because they have like an md5 hash as their file id, src: <https://files.ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Three](https://3.ari-web.xyz/) -- Yeah, just 3 :) src: <https://3.ari-web.xyz/git>\n- My dotfiles: <https://ari-web.xyz/dotfiles>\n- My [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/) overlay: <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>\n- A quite simple sudo alternative for _purely_ Linux (bc I suck and I don't use BSD yet, will be painful to port but eh, we'll see (yes I actually use it)) written in C++: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/kos>\n- A TUI telegram client people seem to love but like it's not working with any modern features because I have not worked on it properly in like 9 months: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/arigram>\n- Yafetch's fork, same name, just a completely reworked build system and I do active porting to newer lua versions: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/yafetch>\n- A bot I made for CollabVM when I was actually active on it, just a simple websocket client ig, just specifically for CollabVM: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/abot>\n- I needed a GNU BASH plugin manager which doesn't take 3 hours to start up and load all the plugins so I made my own, actually I do that often, whenever I can't find proper software that fits me, I just make my own: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/baz>\n- Youtube CLI client I guess, some people seem to like it, although it's quite meh, there are many better alternatives, I still use it from time to time: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/myt>\n- A purely POSIX sh functional daemon manager on top of SysVinit: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/arci>\n- Some tools I use for generating passwords, validating them, etc. I like my passwords strong: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n- Licence manager, quite useful, purely POSIX sh, I find using it quite a lot because I really don't want to go manually find and fill in licence templates: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n- SearX meta-search-engine CLI, as you can tell I really like CLI tools, my terminal is my literal life, I use it sometimes too i guess: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/searx-cli>\n- A simple package manager for the R programming language: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/cran>\n- Make projects from templates, I use it as often as I use lmgr, because I hate doing things manually if I can easily automate it: https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkproj\n- Random\n    - A fork of vimbuddy script to make it cuter ig: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/vimbuddy.vim>\n    - A fork of google's codefm for vim which has many more formatters and a less complicated contribution system: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/vim-codefmt>\n    - My go at some of the coreutils, I barely work on it though: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/sm-coreutils>\n    - A bar script for DWM window manager: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/bdwmb>\n    - My build of the Linux kernel: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/dino-kernel>\n    - A build of DWM for the EndeavourOS GNU/Linux distribution made by me: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/enDWMvour>\n    - The coffee theme organization: <https://github.com/coffee-theme/>\n\nPlus a bunch others, some private, some unreleased, some just too small to share lol, some just have\nbad code, actually some of that bad code is intentional, so like I got obsessed with stack based languages\nand I got 2 attempts at making 2:\n\n- [Rys](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/rys)\n- [Fa](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/fa)\n\nAll of them use python as a bootstrap and had a plan to self-host, Rys is just dead although Fa I'm pretty\nsure is turing complete, also I think it's possible to self-host it, I'm just too lazy to do so, also too\nlazy to prove its turing compleeness, the reason why the code is bad is because I literally did not try,\n'It's just a stupid script to what will disappear after some time' I thought, although Fa is def\nnot a fully dead project lol\n\nKay, so besides those, ari-web also has pages ig, like I don't think I can consider\nthem projects but yk, it's all in the main page kinda, actually a lot of it is indexed\nat <https://www.ari-web.xyz/page/90s> although I'd suggest not visiting it if you like\nhaving eyes\n\n## Tools\n\nI am a Linux user as of now, I usually work with Linux, although I try to be as friendly\nas possible towards other \\*NIX-like operating systems, examples being BSD and MacOS,\nmainly BSD though as I myself got plans for 2023 to switch to it, Linux is getting too\nmainstream and large for my taste, although most likely I will still be using Linux\nis some form or another\n\nMy code editor is [ViM](https://www.vim.org/), a lightweight TUI code editor which is really extensible, vim\nis extremely fast and also has a very powerful plugin system using various languages (even compiled ones)\nbounded together by VimScript, there is another project called [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) which tries to improve\nmore things on it because vim is an extremely old project which is basically controlled by one person,\nalthough still many people contribute, NeoVim is more speed and community focused, although I prefer ViM\nbecause I don't need the extra features and improvements nvim brings with it\n\nMy main interpreted language is Python, a very powerful, abstract high level programming language,\nalso quite powerful with its ability to load C and C++ extensions for lower level access, its API\nis fairly simple, you just work with basic PyObjects\n\nMy main compiled languages are C and C++, as I'm not a huge fan of OOP and I barely find use\nfor it, I mainly use C++ for its type system and namespaces, I also like C, a very simple\nand small programming language with low level access to the point of assembly, one thing which\nI don't really like about C is that you basically work with raw pointers all the time, C++\nmakes it less of a pain in my opinion\n\nFor configuration languages I prefer JSON, JSONC or DOSINI, all of them have their own uses,\nbut one works better than others in certain cases, JSON works well for basic config with\nmultiple types, JSONC works better for bigger and more complex configuration and DOSINI\npretty much works on anything that uses repositories or needs a basic header-key-value\nconfig, like `{\"header\": {\"key\": \"value\"}}` is a much more painful syntax than just\n\n    [header]\n    key = value\n\nAlso we cannot live without scripts, they help up automate repetitive tasks like building\na C++ binary with a whole bunch of flags, Makefiles are cool, but quite painful, also I use 4 spaces\nrather than tabs (yes ik so controversial smh how dare I wasted space blah blah blah) and Makefiles\nforce you to use tabs, which is extremely annoying, so I just resort to using POSIX sh and in very\nvery very rare cases where I need to use more special features I use BASH\n\nMy web stack for frontend is mainly (S)CSS, JS and HTML, although I like TS more, usually\nI'm just too lazy to set it up and end up running into countless bugs just because of people's beloved\nJavaScript (+ other million languages that have 'Java' in their name but have nothing in common with java),\nSCSS is also not a rare thing for me to use, it just requires some transpiling and you get way more features\nthan in CSS, I mainly use it in styles that require me to use a central configuration file or I just need\nthose extra features, for backend I usually use python with the flask web framework and jinja templating\nengine, if I need it also an SQLite3 database using SQLAlchemy because we all know how amazing, enjoyable and secure\nit is to write raw SQL queries <3333, this is a joke for the ones that don't get sarcasm\n\nThe languages I mentioned is not all I know, I have tried many languages, some of them liked,\nsome of them meh, same with knowledge of them, some of them I know better than others,\nfor example racket, scheme. haskell, lua, ruby, chicken, etc. and languages I really didn't\ninclude and which didn't fit like markdown, roff, etc. (which are not *programming* languages)\nI still use them\n\nAnd finally some random things I use can be found on <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/my-gentoo-linux-setup/>\n\nThank you for listening to my presentation about this,\nhave a nice rest of your day\n",

      "content": "So you know how everyone hates every temperature system?\nWhy not make the most ~~painful~~ best one? I did it, I call it torture,\nits measurement unit is T, this the formula for it:\n\n    cos((((C + 273.15) + C + ((C * (9 / 5) + 32))) / 3) + \u03c0) + e\n\nWhere C is temperature in Celcius, in this system precision in\nfloating points is **_VERY_** important because yes\n\nHere's a python implementation of it:\n\n    import math\n\n    def t(c: int) -> float:\n        return math.cos((((c + 273.15) + c + ((c * (9/5) + 32))) / 3) + math.pi) + math.e\n\nWhere argument c is temperature in Celcius, this function\nwill give you the most accurate results it can in python, in\nthis system you must specify at least 6 digits of precision\n\nSome basic examples:\n\n- 100 Celcius, the boiling point of water: 3.2975788083579793 \u00b0T\n- 0 Celcius, the freezing point of water: 2.3426350414279824 \u00b0T\n- 17 Celcius, the current temperature for me: 3.4648639877740215 \u00b0T\n\n## How does this shit work?\n\nIt takes the average of most major temperature units --\nKelvin, Celcius and Fahrenheit, then it adds pi to it and consines\nthe result, after that it adds e and boom we got degrees torture,\nfairly simple\n\nAnyway, now enjoy this amazing system of temperature, if you get\nhotter than 3.0975306904597475 \u00b0T make sure to take a rest from\nthis\n\nGoodbye :)\n",

Python does a lot\nmore than this under the hood, it calls loads of syscalls just for that\nprogram alone:\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % strace python3 hello_world.py 2>&1 | wc -l\n    754\n\nAnd these are only the syscalls, imagine the control flow, there are probably\nmany jumps, complicated loops and generally, if we theoretically generated a CFG\nfor python it'd probably be huge and extremely complicated, this is the reason\nwhy it's **_not simple_**, in logic it does much more than we tell it to,\npython isn't explicit so it makes it very **_easy_** to write\n\nNow, let's write the same program in x86_64 Linux FASM Assembly:\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        mov rax, 1\n        mov rdi, 1\n        mov rsi, hello\n        mov rdx, hello_len\n        syscall\n\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable\n        hello: db \"Hello world\", 10\n        hello_len = $ - hello\n\nNow this is where the fight would begin after I mention \"easy != simple\",\nbecause they have an opinion of \"Less code = simple\", this code is **_simple_**\nbelieve me or not, this code is just **_not easy_**, for a average virgin JavaScript\nor some high-level language developer this code seems overly complicated and\nthey call this code \"Not simple\", when it actually is very simple, it's just\nagain, as I mentioned, not easy.\n\nSo if we compile it and run this binary:\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % fasm hello_world.asm\n    flat assembler  version 1.73.30  (16384 kilobytes memory, x64)\n    3 passes, 234 bytes.\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % strace ./hello_world 2>&1 | wc -l\n    5\n\nSee how much simpler this is, it's only 5 lines of strace output and it's\nactually faster because of the simplicity of this program\n\nPython takes `0:00.05` seconds where as assembly takes `0:00.00` seconds,\nsimplicity not only improves the performance, it improves how much\nyour program needs in resources, python does much much more meaning it needs\na lot more memory, CPU and storage to run\n\nSo basically, simplicity is not ease, ease is what you do and simplicity\nis what your program does, easy as that, hopefully I clarified what I mean\nby \"Simple != easy\" and hopefully I won't need to explain it again :)\n\nHave a nice rest of your day and I hope you now understand what is the difference\nbetween easy and simple :D\n",

Visits for example\n\nAnyway, if anyone is unhappy with this change you can just\n[email me](mailto:ari.web.xyz@gmail.com), [leave an issue under the git repo](/git) or [leave a comment in the users CaO](https://user.ari-web.xyz/)\n\nAnyway, thank you people for staying with me, hope\nari-web continues to grow as both a personal portfolio\nand just a fun site :)\n\nHave a nice rest of your day :D\n",

Lol..\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to another one of my rants, I just have this opinion on modernism,\nhave a nice rest of your day :)\n",

LGBT people, idfk what's their goal but still\n\nThat group thinks they're doing much difference and are acting very opressed\nbecause ??they're straight?? but in all reality they're just a cringe group\nof facebook karens who think LGBT people are ruining Lithuania as LGBT people\nare making some progress in getting more rights in Lithuania\n\nMy mother is a part of this \"movement\" so to say, it's extremely cringe, she's\nnot going to protests and shit but she's still doing cringe ass shit on facebook\nand stuff, talking shit about gay people IRL too\n\nThey're calling being LGBT \"stealing of kids\" as apperantly being LGBT makes you\ninfertile or something and even then if we don't involve LGBT people they're saying\nthat norwegians are stealing kids as it's a happier place or smt\n\nIn Lithuania gay marriage is still illegal as family is defined the same in\nconstitution\n\nArticle 38 of the Lithuanian constitution defines family as the unity between\nman a woman, both parents have the same rights and their right and duty is to\neducate, nurture good Lithuanians, the kids' duty is to respect and care for\ntheir parents and preserve their legacy:\n\n> \u0160eima yra visuomen\u0117s ir valstyb\u0117s pagrindas.\n> Valstyb\u0117 saugo ir globoja \u0161eim\u0105, motinyst\u0119, t\u0117vyst\u0119 ir vaikyst\u0119.\n> Santuoka sudaroma laisvu vyro ir moters sutarimu.\n> Valstyb\u0117 registruoja santuok\u0105, gimim\u0105 ir mirt\u012f.

Wouldn't they make LGBT people\nmore accepted, even though this would save not a huge ammount of people but it'd probably\nstill be _something_ at least I guess, why don't we first climb the human rights ranking\nand then expect some results instead of screaming how people are immigrating to other\ncounties like Norway and say \"They're stealing children from Lithuania\", first\nmake those children feel accepted in the country, then complain.\n\nAnyway, quite disapointing how \"movements\" such as this exist and then complain about\nhow Lithuania is shrinking, goddamn, why did I have to be born in Lithuania lmao,\nbut at least better than some other countries ig?\n",

From what they wear to how they\nspend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect\nwho they are as unique individuals.\n\nAnd every Adventurer is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and\neager to try new things, people with this personality often have a\nfascinating array of passions and interests. With their exploratory\nspirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers\ncan be among the most interesting people you\u2019ll ever meet.\nThe only irony? Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves\nas \u201cjust doing their own thing,\u201d so they may not even realize how\nremarkable they really are. The Beauty of an Open Mind.\n\nAdventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality\ntypes thrive on strict schedules and routines \u2013 but not Adventurers.\nAdventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment.\nAnd they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for\nthe unexpected \u2013 with the result that many of their most cherished memories\nare of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves\nor with their loved ones.\n\nThis flexible mindset makes Adventurers remarkably tolerant and open-minded.\nThese personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of\npeople \u2013 even people who disagree with them or choose radically different lifestyles.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Adventurers are unusually open to changing their minds\nand rethinking their opinions. If any personality type believes in giving something\n(or someone) a second chance, it\u2019s Adventurers. Adventurers want to live in a\nworld where they \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 have the freedom to live as they see fit,\nwithout judgment.\n\nThat said, Adventurers\u2019 go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides.\nPeople with this personality type may struggle to set long-term\nplans \u2013 let alone stick with them. As a result, Adventurers tend to have a\npretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often\nworry about letting other people down. Adventurers may find that adding\na little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel\nmore capable and organized \u2013 without quashing their independent spirits.\nLiving in Harmony.\n\nIn their relationships, Adventurers are warm,friendly, and caring, taking\nwholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But\nmake no mistake: this is an Introverted personality type, meaning that\nAdventurers need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing\nwith others. This alone time is what allows Adventurers to reestablish a\nsense of their own identity \u2013 in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are.\nUnless they take time for themselves, Adventurers can end up feeling lost in\nthe tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances\ninstead of making their own way.\n\nCreative and free-spirited, Adventurers march to the beat of their own drum,\nand it would be easy to assume that they don\u2019t particularly worry what other\npeople think of them. But this isn\u2019t the case \u2013 Adventurers are thoughtful\nand perceptive, able to pick up on people\u2019s unspoken feelings and opinions,\nand it can upset them if they don\u2019t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated.\nWhen faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this personality\ntype not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If they encounter harsh\nor seemingly unfair criticism, they may even lose their tempers in spectacular fashion.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news, too: Adventurers live in the present, and they know\nthat they don\u2019t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing\non how things could be different, people with this personality type have an\nincredible capacity for appreciating what\u2019s right about life just as it is.\nEverywhere they look, Adventurers can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that\nother people might miss \u2013 and this perspective is just one of the many\ngifts that they share with the world.\n",

      "content": "Today I was challenged to make a program in C,\nassembly and then pure ELF-64, I chose a\n[\"Hello world\" program](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program?lang=en),\nand so, I wrote a program in C, then in (NASM x86_64 Linux) assembly and then,\nwell pure ELF-64, Firstly I made a C program to generate the program, I took the\nbytes of it and put it into python...\n\nThen I made a GitHub repo: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/low-hello-world>\n\nBut before that I compiled the ones I needed to and the results shocked me:\n\n- C89 (GCC, stripped): `14KB` [`gcc -std=c89 -s hello_world.c`]\n- Assembly (NASM, stripped): `8.3KB` [`nasm -felf64 hello_world.asm -s && ld -o a.out hello_world.o -s`]\n\nAnd the one that shocked me the most:\n\n- Pure ELF-64: `166B`\n\nAnd that made me think, is assembly... Bloated?\nThe difference is HUGE and they do the same think,\nit's so insane.\n\nSo now I got a project idea in mind, less Bloated assembly,\nbut [idk](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/idk-meaning/)...\n\nIt's so wild how going lower than low level can make\nsuch huge difference, but then again, with using assembly\nand assemblers like [NASM](https://nasm.us/) you get a lot\nmore features and stuff.\n\nBut with manual elf generation you get infinite control,\nwhich is nice.\n\nI know, you can probably [\"Shoot yourself in the foot\"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/shoot-yourself-in-the-foot)\nby manually generating ELF but the amount of space you can save is crazy.\n\nDebugging will also be more painful with manually generating assembly,\nno sections and stuff, but it's still very interesting\n\nAnyway, conclusion, rust is bloated, assembly is bloated,\neverything is bloated, the lower you go the less bloat you\nget apparently, it's nice :)\n\nBut besides that, assembly is still great, C is great, rust... Not\nso much but whatever, don't stop using it because \"Ari said it's bloated\",\nit's more than okay to use them, still very shocking results, assembly\nruns and will always run everything and you can't do anything about that\ngenerating ELF gave me like 947 mental illnesses so I think I will\nstay with assembly, but I will consider making less bloated assembly lol\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to me, sorry if I offended anyone,\nthis wasn't my intention, just sharing the results lol :)\n\nSee you in the next blog, have a good rest of your day :)\n",
